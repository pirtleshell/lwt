You feel that you won't learn much by translating dumb sentences or using grammar books? Learning With Texts offers you the possibility to learn by reading texts in your target language. Concept: when you don't know a word in a text, just click it. We show you the translation, and you will have regular tests to remember it. Ready to go?

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **THIS IS A THIRD PARTY VERSION**. This version is not the
official one, and brings many improvements and new features.
It is quicker, has smaller database size,
and is open for contributions. The official version is on
[source forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts)

> [!NOTE]  
> HugoFara: I don't plan to continue developping LWT on a regular basis. While I may keep maintaining for fun, I recommend [jzohrab/lute-v3](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute-v3) as the main target for development effort in the LWT software family.

## Installation

As LWT is self-hosted, you will need a server, which can be your computer. 
You can either use Docker (recommended), or install it on your machine.

### Docker (any OS)

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (if not already done).

* For an light-weight installation, you may use [HugoFara/lwt-docker-installer](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt-docker-installer).

* To build from source, download the latest release and run:

  ```bash
  cd lwt
  docker compose up # Now open http://localhost:8010/lwt/ in a browser
  ```

### Linux

1. Get the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases). You can also try to download the [latest stable version](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs).
2. Start a shell in the downloaded folder an run: ``./INSTALL.sh``. You may need to run ``chmod +x ./INSTALL.sh`` first.


### Other Systems

1. **Please follow**: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) for setup  instructions.
2. Create ``connect.inc.php`` with an existing database user. Everything is explained at [docs/info.html](https://hugofara.github.io/lwt/docs/info.html#install).

And you are ready to go!

## Description

LWT is a language learning web application. To learn a language, you
need to practice, and we guide you in reading exercises.

First copy/paste any text you want to read. It can be raw text or an RSS feed.

Then, we parse the text. Unknown words will be displayed with different colors,
just click them to see it in a dictionary.

Read as much as you want!

To make sure you memorize new words, you can take review exercises.

The difference with popular remembering software like
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is that we keep track of the
context to help you. By the way, we also ship
an Anki exporter.
