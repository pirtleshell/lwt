# Changelog

This project's changelog. Versions marked with "-fork" come from the community, other versions come from the canonical LWT ("official" branch on Git).
For git tags, official releases are marked like "v1.0.0", while unofficial ones are marked like "v1.0.0-fork".

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* ``langFromDict`` and ``targetLangFromDict`` are now officially coming to the kernel utility functions.
* Text and title boxes change language according to the text's language for short text creation/edition, long text creation and text check ([#111](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/111)).
* Refactored texts with OOP:
  * New class: ``Text`` (in ``inc/classes/Text.php``).
  * New function: ``edit_texts_form`` (in ``edit_texts.php``) that takes a Text object as input.
* Tests (checking if you know words) now use AJAX ([#112](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/112)), it has several advantages:
  * Musics play fully
  * Page do not need to reload.
  * The timer continues instead of resetting.
* REST API, the new ``inc/ajax.php`` is intended to continue developping itself as a REST API.

### Changed

* Prettier UI to navigate between text creation/edition/archive pages.
* The long text import page looks a bit nicer.

### Fixed

* When editing an existing text, surrounding spaces are no longer inserted ([#92](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/92)).
* Language code is better detected from translator url when editing an existing language.
* The field "Short Text Import" on long text import and was not redirecting to
the intendended page. Same goes for "New Text" on "Archived Texts" page.
* It was impossible to archive more than one text ([#118](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/118)).
* Testing a word was not changing it's color.
* A warning was sent 'Undefined array key "query"' when creating a new word ([#121](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/121)).
* A warning when savings settings in ``settings.php`` was sometimes displayed ([#121](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/121)).
* Test header was different when testing languages or terms since 2.1.0-fork.
* Wrong link to documentation (``info.php`` instead of ``docs/info.html``). Signaled by Mooncake on Discord.

## 2.8.1-fork (April 14 2023)

### Changed in 2.8.1-fork

* Updated some documentation screenshots: home screen, language edition and terms upload.

### Fixed in 2.8.1-fork

* Since 2.8.0-fork, PHP installations with ext-dom absent or disabled could not display text.
* Using the import terms feature, it is better detected if local infile is enabled.
* Since 2.2.2-fork, many multi-words were not displayed, as explained in [#70](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/70). Issues may remain.
* Auto-translation of all words (bulk translate) could not open dictionaries starting with '*'.
* Since 2.7.0-fork, using a dictionary starting with "ggl.php" was creating a fatal error on opening text.

### Full Changelog for 2.8.1-fork

* [2.8.0...2.8.1](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.8.0...2.8.1)

## 2.8.0-fork (April 08 2023)

### Added in 2.8.0-fork

* Responsive design: LWT gets easier to visualize on phone!

### Changed in 2.8.0-fork

* The language settings wizard is now *open by default* on new language creation.
* Potential breaking change in the way words are displayed while reading. The target was to make the code more robust.
* ``item_parser`` and ``echo_term`` in ``do_text_text.php`` now both takes an optional ``$expr`` argument.
* Terms import form changed for a simpler presentation. It becomes easier to use to use on your phone.
* Many tables are now displayed larger (when your screen has the available space).
* Updated composer dependencies.

### Fixed in 2.8.0-fork

* Removed warnings: dictionaries url without query do no longer raise warnings.
* Feeds:
  * Click "New Text" on the first page of ``do_feeds.php`` had no effect. Changed to "New Feed".
  * Step 2 of feed wizard was sometimes failing because ``$_SESSION['wizard']['host']`` was a string an not an array.
  * Type error in ``get_links_from_new_feed`` was breaking step 2 of feed wizard.
  * Loading feeds could result in malformed SQL, see [#100](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/100). Thanks [@maanh96](https://github.com/maanh96) for the hint!
* Docker: ``media/`` was neither accessible nor saved to a container ([#106](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/106)). Thanks to [@parradam](https://github.com/parradam) for signaling and solving the issue!
* On creating a language, the Glosbe dictionary comes with a "?lwt_popup=1" to open in new window by default.
* Japanese pronunciation: works even if the language is not exactly called "Japanese", see [#103](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/103).
* Expressions containing word feature repaired! [#90](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/90).
* On text-to-speech settings, the region was often not displayed.

### Full Changelog for 2.8.0-fork

* [2.7.0...2.8.0](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.7.0...2.8.0)

## 2.7.0-fork (March 14 2023)

### Added in 2.7.0-fork

* The translation and romanization of new words can now be automatic.
  * Supported automatic translation is achieved using [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/).
  * Romanization using [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) (Japanese only) toward katakana only.
* A lot of improvements for language creation/edition:
  * More intuitive fields, better interactions with the user, etc...
  * A "Pop-Up" checkbox helps you choose if the website should be displayed in a pop-up.
* LWT becomes easier to install and maintain for users:
  * An installer for Linux users at ``INSTALL.sh`` helps installing requirements and configuration.
  * Database creation wizard (``database_wizard.php``) to help setting the connection with the database.
  * A server data page at ``server_data.php`` showing all relevant information.
* In ``index.php``:
  * ``get_server_data_table`` replaces ``get_server_data`` as a better designed function.
  * ``index_do_main_page`` now renders the page to avoid global variables.
  * You get warnings if the PHP version is too low, or if a newer version of LWT is released.
* ``pagestart_kernel_nobody`` in ``inc/kernel.php`` that displays the minimal HTML formatting.
* ``inc/classes/`` folder for a better incorporation of OOP.
  * ``inc/classes/Term`` defines the ``Term`` class representing a word or multi-word.
  * ``inc/classes/Language`` defines the ``Language`` class representing a language.
* Post-Install Documentation added:
  * MeCab without and with Docker, Thanks to [@99MengXin](https://github.com/99MengXin) for the link ([#94](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/94#issuecomment-1437030748)).
  * LibreTranslate integration.
  * TTS issues, as suggested by [@asdrubalivan](https://github.com/asdrubalivan) in [#85](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/85#issuecomment-1369751473).

### Changed in 2.7.0-fork

* Graphic review:
  * Headers reviewed. Most h4 headers became div.bigger, and h3 became h1 level headers.
  * We now use responsive design instead of fixed-size.
  * All themes updated accordingly, so themes were modified.
  * ``do_text_page`` (``do_text.php``) and ``do_test_page`` (``do_test.php``) now enlarge the body.
* ``echo_lwt_logo`` in ``inc/session_utility.php`` echoes a logo, without information on the table set used
because it was useless. This information is now displayed on the welcome page.
* Access to the database prefix edition at ``start.php`` was reviewed and simplified. It is still considered a legacy feature.
* Language creation reviewed:
  * When creating a new language, the language wizard do no longer display in a pop-up but in the main window.
  * Select option boxes replaced by checkboxes (better accessibility).
* Updated [hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in](http://briancherne.github.io/jquery-hoverIntent/)
from 1.8.0 to 1.10.2. This brings some bug fixes.
* "TO DO" changed to a more explicit "Unknown words" in text header.
* Refactored ``bulk_translate_word.php``. It has a better visual aspect and works better.
* Updated composer dependencies.
  * vimeo/psalm updated from ^4.12 to ^5.6.
  * phpunit/phpunit updated from ^9.5 to ^10.0.
* Changed to the text from YouTube feature (``text_from_yt.php``):
  * Refactored.
  * Moved from root folder to ``inc/``.
  * This is still an experimental feature!
* Moved Google API files:
  * Moved ``googleTimeToken.php`` from root folder to ``inc/google_time_token.php``.
  * Moved ``googleTranslateClass.php`` from root folder to ``inc/classes/GoogleTranslate.php``.
* Updates in demo database:
  * Faster to install. ``install_demo_db_sql.gz`` uncompressed to ``install_demo_db.sql``. Functions adapted.
  * Dict links changed: ### replaced by lwt_term, * replaced by lwt_popup=1, some dict url protocol changed to https.

### Fixed in 2.7.0-fork

* Markdown: enforced consistency with official style recommendations. The documentation display got improved.
* The default date for new words was note accepted depending on the SQL configuration, causing issues with Docker installation. See [#78](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/78).
* Bulk translate words:
  * Translating with bulk translate was not updating word rendering.
  * All broom icons icon were display in the screen top-right corner, and not
  at the right if text field.
* Main page (``index.php``) was not rendered properly on non-default theme.
* Changing language name was breaking this, this is fixed:
  * Text header was sometimes not available.
  * It was breaking full text-to-speech dispatcher. Issue signaled [with issue #80](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/80#issuecomment-1368180304)
* Support for PHP 7.4 restored, wrappers for ``str_starts_with``, ``str_ends_with``, ``str_contains``.
* The encoding of ``docs/info.html`` is finally fixed!
* ``ggl.php`` feature fixed!
* Multi-words:
  * Sometimes multi-words indicator was cut, resulting in strange display ([#89](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/89)).
  * For Japanese: multi-words indicator was before each character, this is fixed [#96](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/96).
* Wrong link to documentation (``docs/info.php`` instead of ``docs/info.html``) on the help button (main page). Signaled by babaeali on Discord.
* Depending on browser, clicking on deletion button for active texts had no effect.

### Deprecated in 2.7.0-fork

* Dictionary and translator URIs changed:
  * They should **always** be proper URLs.
  * Replacing ``###`` by ``lwt_term`` is strongly recommended!
  * "*" At the beginning of an URI should be replaced by ``lwt_popup=1`` as an argument.
  * ``ggl.php`` should be replaced by the file full URL, for instance "<http://localhost/lwt/ggl.php>".

### Full Changelog for 2.7.0-fork

* [2.6.0...2.7.0](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.6.0...2.7.0)

## 2.6.0-fork (January 01 2023)

### Added in 2.6.0-fork

* Frames resizing is back! The text reading and test interfaces updated in several ways. Based on several suggestions such as [#60](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/60).
  * The desktop interface is now much similar to what it was before 2.2.1-fork.
  * The mobile interface for texts unchanged (2.2.1-fork to 2.5.3-fork).
  * You can resize frames on desktop.
* Many new functions officially introduced in PHP and JS. Some of these function were already present in the code but undocumented.

### Changed in 2.6.0-fork

* UX: Faster testing: you do no longer need to enter "Space" first for speed testing, except for status down and change. Related to [#71](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/71).
* UI:
  * Do no longer show "[]" near words when they are no tags. ``getWordTagList`` behavior changed (``inc/session_utility.php``).
  * Tests have a better general aspect thanks to CSS cleanning.
* PHP:
  * ``do_test.php``, ``edit_texts.php``, ``edit_words.php`` and ``set_test_status.php`` now explicitly require a running session. They were silently failing before this release.
  * ``save_setting_redirect.php`` moved to ``inc/save_setting_redirect.php``.
  * Psalm static code analysis of all PHP files.
  * We use "EOP" for end-of-paragraph markers instead of misleading "EOS" (MeCab).
  * Slightly changed how a connection is established with SQL. It makes messages more relevant when SQL is not running.
  * Not Japanese texts now always use the PHP parser. The SQL parser is no longer used.
* JS: Some deprecated functions ``escape`` and ``unescape`` were replaced by modern equivalents ``encodeURIcomponent`` and ``decodeURIcomponent``. This may lead to changes in cookies, notably making them work better.
* DB: the NO_ZERO_DATE mode is no longer required, see [#78](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/78).
  * In the ``words`` table, replaced the default timestamp ``0000-00-00 00:00:00`` by ``0000-00-00 00:00:01``.
  * The demo database underwent the same change.
* Updated ``composer.lock``.
* Docker: more default options, documentation updated.

### Deprecated in 2.6.0-fork

* ``do_test_test_css`` in ``do_test_test.php`` is deprecated since it was causing display issues. Its CSS rules were trimmed.

### Removed in 2.6.0-fork

* The ability to use a dictionary with a specific encoding, introduced in 1.0.2, is being removed. It was making things overwhelmingly complex and caused issues, as signaled in [#58](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/58). Adapted from PR [#59](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/59).

### Fixed in 2.6.0-fork

* Docker:
  * Docker integration repaired ([#37](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/37))! Huge thanks to [@hakuro-jp](https://github.com/hakuro-jp) for the initial help and [@darkone23](https://github.com/darkone23) for the final solution. Without you two I would have long given up with Docker.
  * Docker continuous integration is back as well due to a rewrite of the workflow.
* Texts:
  * The *audio* player was no longer working since 2.1.0-fork since the play button was hidden.
  * Save text position (``inc/ajax_save_text_position.php``) was broken for all texts. This is fixed.
  * Right frames should hide automatically but they often don't ([#61](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/61)). Merged PR [#62](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/62).
  * Japanese parsing is now better, and uses PHP only (the local_infile SQL functionality is no longer used). Related to PR [#43](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/43).
  * One-word not Japanese texts do no longer result in a crash ([#80](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/80)), whoever uses them.
* Tests:
  * Header was hidden during tests on Chrome-based browsers.
  * Testing specific terms was broken ([#66](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/66)) and tests were sometimes not counting score. Solution inspired from PR [#67](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/67) from [@jzohrab](https://github.com/jzohrab).
  * Sometimes tests were loop-reloading clicking after setting new status, this is fixed.
* JS:
  * You should no longer see annoying console messages of "cClick" crashing on "obj is null".
* PHP:
  * Type fixes thanks to psalm:
    * ``get_first_value`` documentation updated since it was also returning ``float`` and ``int``.
    * ``get_similar_terms`` in ``simterms.php`` officially returns int.
  * Inconsistent option in ``inc/ajax_save_setting.php``.
    * Since 2.2.2-fork, you had to use a GET request to use it, resulting in authorization errors.
    * POST requests are now again the default way to use it.
    * PHP tries to set the allow_local_infile option during the connection with SQL ([#20](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/20), [#40](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/40)).
* UI
  * Audio in ``edit_texts.php`` was never shown.
  * When adding text, the user was ask to create a ``media`` folder in ``...``, corrected to ``..``.
* DB:
  * For some users it was impossible to install the default database due to the use of a ZERO date ([#78](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/78)).
  * Deleted wrong database instructions ``ADD DROP INDEX TiTextLC`` altering ``temptextitems`` in ``update_database`` of ``database_connect.php``.

### Full Changelog for 2.6.0-fork

* [2.5.3...2.6.0](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.5.3...2.6.0)

## 2.5.3-fork (November 06 2022)

### Added in 2.5.3-fork

* Links to the Discord community (``README.md`` and ``inc/kernel_utility.php``).

### Changed in 2.5.3-fork

* Renamed ``connect_mamp.php`` to ``connect_mamp.inc.php`` for consistency with documentation.
* "I KNOW ALL" button becomes "Set All to Known" and "IGNORE ALL" becomes "Ignore All".
* Changed the messages when clicking "Set All to Known" or "Ignore All".
* Uncomplete code linting in ``bulk_translate_words.php``. For phone users, it now properly focuses on the main screen after use.
* Only sentences containing more than 70% of known words are shown were testing sentences. Based on an idea from [#53](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/53), with contribution of PR [#65](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/65).

### Fixed in 2.5.3-fork

* Left-to-right languages where displayed as right-to-left when checking them, as signaled in [pull request #42](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/42), thanks [@Heliozoa](https://github.com/Heliozoa)!
* People who didn't fill the URL for Google Translate were seeing deprecation warnings while using using the ``bulk_translate`` functionality (clicking in "TO DO" for editing multiple new words). Bulk translate itself is not fixed, but warnings are no longer displayed. Merged [pull request #44](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/44), from [@Heliozoa](https://github.com/Heliozoa).
* Multiple fixes to the "I Known All Words" feature. Great thanks to [@jzohrab](https://github.com/jzohrab)!
  * Setting all words to well-known was resulting in a crash when no words were added as well-known (``all_words_wellknown.php``).
  * Setting all words to well-known was resulting in a crash when multiple words had the same lowercase value. See issue [#46](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/46)!
  * Words were not updated in the view unless reparsing the text ([#48](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/48)). Merged pull request [#49](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/49).
* In the main dropdown menu, the option "Text-to-Speech Settings" was still leading to ``tts.php`` (now ``text_to_speech_settings.php``). Merged pull request [#51](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/51), thanks [@jzohrab](https://github.com/jzohrab).
* Database backup/restoration:
  * Fixed database backup, signaled in [#55](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/55).
  * Fixed the database restoration, apparently broken since 2.0.3-fork. Pull request [#56](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/56) by [@jzohrab](https://github.com/jzohrab).
* Sentences with unknown words were showed in test when it was not supposed to be the case ([#52](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/52) and [#64](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/64)).

### Full Changelog for 2.5.3-fork

* [2.5.2...2.5.3](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.5.2...2.5.3)

## 2.5.2-fork (September 27 2022)

### Changed in 2.5.2-fork

* Refactored ``upload_words.php``.

### Fixed in 2.5.2-fork

* Multi-words insertion for languages using no space is now repaired! Thanks to [@gaoxiangluke](https://github.com/gaoxiangluke) for signaling it ([#38](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/38)).
* Terms import (``upload_words.php``) can now be used with ``@@GLOBAL.local_infile`` (MySQL) set to 0.
* Deleted a parasite ";" that was displayed after importing terms.

### Full Changelog for 2.5.2-fork

* [2.5.1...2.5.2](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.5.1...2.5.2)

## 2.5.1-fork (September 16 2022)

### Fixed in 2.5.1-fork

* Having ``@@GLOBAL.local_infile`` (MySQL) set to 0, or any configuration disabling ``LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE``, was causing a fatal error on adding a new text. This is fixing by a slower method.
  * If ``local_infile`` is enabled, no change should be noticed.
  * This was signaled in issues [#20](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/20) and [#40](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/40).
* The WordPress binding scripts had multiple issues as reported in [#41](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/41), thanks [@Redmattski](https://github.com/Redmattski)!

### Full Changelog for 2.5.1-fork

* [2.5.0...2.5.1](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.5.0...2.5.1)

## 2.5.0-fork (July 08 2022)

### Added in 2.5.0-fork

* Compatibility with PHP 8+!
* Updated with LWT 2.0.3, solving incompatibilities with PHP 8.1 throwing MySQLI errors.
* Introducing the new class ``Term`` in ``edit_mword.php``. This class is yet to be considered experimental, so expect important changes, but should gradually get used everywhere.
* ``insert_expression_from_mecab`` in ``session_utility.php``. Better name and behavior for ``insertExpressionFromMeCab`` (see deprecations).

### Changed in 2.5.0-fork

* Composer dependencies updated.
* The Docker container now uses PHP 8.1 (instead of 7.4).

### Fixed in 2.5.0-fork

* For some user, the --secure-priv-file option was still required to be on. This was due to a conflict between PHP and MySQLI authorizations.
* When deleting a word, it was previously necessary to reload the page to see a visual change.
* Multi-words insertion fixed.
* "Show Sentences" button during words edition was broken since 2.3.0-fork.

### Full Changelog for 2.5.0-fork

* [2.4.1...2.5.0](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.4.1...2.5.0)

### Deprecated in 2.5.0-fork

* ``set_word_count`` in ``database_connect.php`` had a misleading name. It was changed to ``init_word_count``.
* ``insertExpressionFromMeCab`` deprecated for ``insert_expression_from_mecab`` in ``session_utility.php``.
* PHP <8 won't be tested anymore. You are highly encouraged to update to PHP 8+!

## 2.0.3 (February 15 2022)

### Fixed in 2.0.3

* An incompatibility with PHP 8.1+ (changed mysqli_report default setting in PHP 8.1+) has been fixed.

## 2.4.1-fork (June 09 2022)

### Changed in 2.4.1-fork

* Some function signature were not logical in ``edit_texts.php``. These signatures remain untouched for backward compatibility, but the internals were changed.
* Texts without tag do no longer display a "[]" string next to the title. Applies to both archived and active texts.

### Fixed in 2.4.1-fork

* A typo was breaking the feeds count in ``edit_languages.php``, creating annoying notices as illustrated at [#35](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/35).
* The error "[1290] The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option" should no longer appear when trying to save Japanese texts. It was referenced [here](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/34#issuecomment-1141976723) in [issue #34](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/34).
* The "Undefined index: trans in .../bulk_translate_word.php" notice fixed.
* The "Undefined index: WoText in .../delete_word.php" notice fixed.
* Repaired ``long_text_import.php`` for non-Japanese texts, it was broken since 2.4.0. Thanks to [@rc-ops](https://github.com/rc-ops) for this issue [#33](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/33).
* Text statistics were not displayed when there was more than one text since 2.2.2-fork.

### Full Changelog for 2.4.1-fork

* [2.4.0...2.4.1](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.4.0...2.4.1)

## 2.4.0-fork (May 23 2022)

### Added in 2.4.0-fork

* The external dependency for Japanese parsing, MeCab, is now more easily detected on Windows and Linux.
* Better integration of Docker.

### Changed in 2.4.0-fork

* You must not only include ``pgm.js`` to ask the user before exiting but also the new function ``ask_before_exiting``.
* ``splitCheckText`` was split into smaller functions.
* Refactored ``edit_languages.php`` with functional paradigm.

### Fixed in 2.4.0-fork

* Many pages were asking before exiting while it was unnecessary.
* Made bigger buttons and unified the presentation of ``edit_texts.php``,
``edit_archivedtexts.php``, ``long_text_import.php`` and ``do_feeds.php``. It solves
issue [#29](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/29).
* Japanese texts were ill parsed on Windows. The issue [#23](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/23) is now solved!
[@rc-ops](https://github.com/rc-ops), arigatou!
* The number of texts, expressions and so on was always 0 in ``edit_languages.php``.
* On Windows, annoying notices were often displayed in ``edit_languages.php``.

### Removed in 2.4.0-fork

* The HTML code documentation is no longer included in the dev branch.
* The unnecessary JS files were removed since they were all merged in ``js/``.

### Full Changelog for 2.4.0-fork

* [2.3.0...2.4.0](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/compare/2.3.0...2.4.0)

## 2.3.0-fork (April 25 2022)

### Added in 2.3.0-fork

* Commands included in ``Makefile`` where transcripted in ``composer.json``.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) integration! It is done through ``Dockerfile``, ``docker-compose.yml``, ``.dockerignore`` and ``.env`` files.
* You can click on a read icon in order to read a word.
* Text-To-Speech (TTS) Settings!
  * Change the language rate, pitch, or local region for text-to-speech.
* Early support of local videos, discussed in [#9](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/9) with [@chaosarium](https://github.com/chaosarium).

### Changed in 2.3.0-fork

* mbstring and mysqli extensions are now clearly asked for by Composer.
* The "database update" part of ``check_update_db`` in ``inc/database_connect.php`` was moved to ``update_database``.
* Almost all JS goes in one file when minified. This has several reasons:
  * Better browser caching: JS code is downloaded once for all.
  * Easier maintaining: it was difficult to manage which php file was needing which JS script.
  * Consistency: scripts were calling functions that should be imported from other files, making the debugging difficult.
* Feed wizard changes
  * The feed wizard got a little broken: the "next" button is always active, even if you did not select text and click "Get".
  * It's style was uniformized with your current theme.
* ``tts.php`` becomes ``text_to_speech_settings.php``. As this file was unused, it is not considered as a breaking change.
* Refactored ``all_words_wellknown.php``, ``edit_texts.php``. Those pages should load a bit faster.
* We do no longer load pages in [Almost Standards Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode). Unless you use some Netscape browser, it should not impact you.

### Deprecated in 2.3.0-fork

* In ``edit_texts.php``, it was not displayed in the barchart when knowing 1 word. Thanks [@chaosarium](https://github.com/chaosarium) for signaling it (issue [#11](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/11)).
* Tags were breaking text modification. Issue [#12](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/12), thanks [@chaosarium](https://github.com/chaosarium).
* In edit_texts.php, unknown words (with status 0), had no abbreviation display between parentheses. It was showing "Unknown ()".

Changes from official LWT version 1.5.20 imported:  

* Possibility to display similar terms while creating or editing a term. This will give you more language insight, and may ease inputting new terms that are similar. The number of displayed similar terms can be set from 0 (old behavior, default) to 9 on the "Settings" page. Clicking on the green icon in front of a similar term will copy the translation and romanization into the form fields for further editing. Important: If you want to use this new feature, you must change the setting "Similar terms to be displayed while adding/editing a term" to a value greater than 0. It will make more sense to do this if you have already many saved terms (e.g. more than 1,000). If you start with a language and have only a few terms, no or not very similar terms will be normally displayed and this feature will not make much sense.
* "https://" dictionary URIs are now allowed in the language settings. Checking of dictionary URIs in the language settings has been improved.

### Changed in 1.6.1-fork

* The Glosbe dictionary page has been improved with a simple form to change the term and do a requery if you are unhappy with the query results.
* The jQuery and jPlayer libraries have been updated to v1.11.1 and v2.7.0, respectively. The jQuery.ScrollTo package has been updated to v1.4.13. The Floating Menu package has been updated to v1.12.  

* Broken links corrected or deleted. From now on, only the installation with EasyPHP for Windows and MAMP for Mac OS X will be explained in detail and is recommended. Other local web server packages, like XAMPP, etc., are of course still possible, but it's beyond the scope of this document to explain all the details for every webserver package (it will also confuse most LWT users who are not familiar with web server packages and their setup).
* "Mobile\_Detect.php" updated to v2.8.3.
* Documentation updated.

## 1.5.20 (September 22 2014)

### Changed in 1.5.20

* "Mobile\_Detect.php" updated to v2.8.3.

### Fixed in 1.5.20

## 1.5.19 (September 15 2014)

* Missing tag cache updating fixed (in "Add tag in all/marked texts or terms").  
* Tag caches now also work properly if several instances of LWT are installed in parallel directories on the same server.  
* Information about [which web browser to use for LWT](info.html#abstract) in this document updated.  

## 1.5.18 (September 14 2014)

### Added in 1.5.18

* Possibility to display similar terms while creating or editing a term. This will give you more language insight, and may ease inputting new terms that are similar. The number of displayed similar terms can be set from 0 (old behavior, default) to 9 on the "Settings" page. Clicking on the green icon in front of a similar term will copy the translation and romanization into the form fields for further editing. Important: If you want to use this new feature, you must change the setting "Similar terms to be displayed while adding/editing a term" to a value greater than 0. It will make more sense to do this if you have already many saved terms (e.g. more than 1,000). If you start with a language and have only a few terms, no or not very similar terms will be normally displayed and this feature will not make much sense.
* New sort option for texts, terms or tags: "Oldest first".  
* The Catalan language has been added to the Language Settings Wizard.

### Changed in 1.5.18

* "https://" dictionary URIs are now allowed in the language settings. Checking of dictionary URIs in the language settings has been improved. The Glosbe dictionary page has been improved with a simple form to change the term and do a requery if you are unhappy with the query results.

If you prefer faster term table display, choose the other sort options.

### Changed in 1.5.12

* Much better Tablet/iPad® user experience in screens with several frames. There is a new setting "Frame Set Display Mode" where you can select how frame sets are displayed on different devices (default: "Auto"). If you prefer the old mode also on mobile devices, set this to "Force Non-Mobile".

* A new test/review type "Table" has been added in the testing area. Words, translations, romanizations, sentences and status are presented in a table. You may hide and/or sort columns. After testing yourself, you can reveal the hidden information by clicking into the table cell, and change your status.

### Changed in 1.5.4

* Player appearance improved. Some settings, that were not saved until now, are now automatically saved. Documentation and some screenshots updated.  

## 1.5.3 (June 14 2013)

### Added in 1.5.3

* New Feature: It is now possible to create and to use not only ONE set of LWT tables within one database. You are now able to create and use unlimited LWT table sets within one database (as space and MySQL limitations permit). This feature is especially useful for users who want to set up a multi user environment with a set of tables for each user. You can also create one table set for every language you study - this allows you to create different term/text tags for each language. If you don't need this feature, you just use LWT like in earlier versions with the "default table set". Read more [here](info.html#mue) and [here](info.html#database).  

### Changed in 1.5.3

* Installation procedures (EasyPHP) updated.  

## 1.5.1 (June 07 2013)

### Added in 1.5.1

You may also click on a single term or a single annotation to show or to hide it. This enables you to test yourself or to concentrate on one text only. Romanizations, if available, appear now while hovering over a term.

### Changed in 1.5.1

* Documentation and screenshots updated.  

## 1.5.0 (April 22 2013)

### Added in 1.4.10

* New option in "Print" screen: annotation can now also be placed above the term (via [Ruby characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character)). This is especially helpful for Chinese and Japanese, when annotating the text with the romanization (Pinyin, Hiragana, Katakana). Your browser must support ruby markup. Firefox needs the [HTML Ruby Add-On](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/html-ruby/) to display ruby markup properly.

### Changed in 1.4.10

* Help document updated.  

## 1.4.9 (August 29 2012)

* Correction in do\_text\_header.php: fix negative audio positions to zero. See also [this thread](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lwt/forums/forum/1813497/topic/5220016).

## 1.4.7 (April 6 2012)

## 1.4.0 (September 09 2011)

### Added in 1.4.0

* Mobile Version (experimental, via mobile.php): Selection of Language, Text, and Sentence, Playing the audio (if exists), Reading the text either sentence-by-sentence or term-by-term (saved words shown with translation, romanization, and status (via color). This mobile interface does not yet allow data manipulations.

### Changed in 1.2.1

* Documentation and screenshots updated.  

## 1.2.0 (August 24 2011)

* Tagging of terms introduced. Tags are little pieces of information (20 characters max., no spaces, no commas, case sensitive!) attached to terms to help you catagorize and organize your terms. You can import (CSV, TSV) and export (Anki, TSV) terms together with tag information. Two new tables save tag information, and they are created automatically during first usage after update.  
* Display of example sentences is now delayed.  
* Backup creates the database SQL file now as a gzipped file. Restore can process old unzipped or new gzipped files. Gzipped files are much smaller in size (10-20 % of original size).  
* Documentation and screenshots updated.

### Changed in 1.1.1

* The Status filter lists have been expanded.
* Documentation and screenshots updated.

### Fixed in 1.1.1

* Fixed problems with non-ASCII characters in media file names (hopefully).

## 1.1.0 (August 16 2011)

### Added in 1.1.0

* New status display during tests: "Elapsed Time / Total = Not yet tested + Wrong + Correct", plus a small bar graph.  
* Tests can now be done also via key strokes (but you must first click in the test frame): SPACE: show solution, UP/DOWN: Status +1/-1, ESC: don't change status, NUMBER KEYS 1-5: set status to 1-5, I: set "Ignored", W: set "Well known", E: edit term.  
* In the "Read Text" frame, the next unknown (blue) word in the text can now be shown for term creation just by pressing the RETURN key. The term will be marked by a red border. You type in the translation, etc., and press RETURN to save the word. Now you can press RETURN again to show the next unknown (blue) word, enter a translation, save it, and so on... There is sometimes the problem that some external dictionaries catch the focus although the cursor should be in the translation field in the edit frame. Especially Chrome behaves badly, and I cannot change this. Please try different dictionaries and/or browsers.  
* You can also review/manage saved (non-blue) terms with key strokes in the "Read Text" frame (RIGHT or SPACE: next term, LEFT: previous term, PAGE-UP or HOME: first term, PAGE-DOWN or END: last term, NUMBER KEYS 1-5: set current term status to 1-5, I: set current term status to "Ignored", W: set current term status to "Well known", E: edit current term, ESC: reset). The current term has a black border and the frame scrolls automatically. The term is displayed in the top right frame.  
* New refresh button refreshes media files combo box (without page reload) on the text input/edit screen.  
* Information added how to install LWT at a (free) webhoster.

### Changed in 1.1.0

* DB design altered: Table "words" changed: 3 new columns to make random word selection (in tests) and score calculation/query faster.  
* Translation, romanization and sentence are now optional. An empty translation or an asterisk in the translation field are equivalent. Terms without translation or in status "Well Known" or "Ignore" will never be tested. Import of terms without translation is now possible.  
* Textarea input boxes have now all a maximum text/bytes length check.  
* Testing algorithm revised, simplified and optimized.  
* Terms due today and tomorrow are marked in score column (red/yellow) in terms table.  
* Documentation and screenshots updated, new floating menu.

### Fixed in 1.1.0

* EasyPHP installation corrected.  

## 1.0.4 (August 11 2011)

### Added in 1.0.4

* Demo database installation is now done within LWT (optional). If the database is empty, a hint on the main screen is displayed either to install the demo db or to start with the definition of a language. Backup/Restore now with more hints and an option to install the demo database.  
* Documentation and screenshots updated.  

## 1.0.3 (August 09 2011)

### Added in 1.0.3

* New button to open a new text immediately after saving.  
* Dictionaries can now be opened not only within the frame set (default) but also in a popup window (please deactivate popup window blocking in your browser!). To open a dictionary in a separate popup window, put an asterisk \* in front of the Uniform Resource Identifier (Example: \*<http://mywebdict.com?q=###).> Please use this method if a web dictionary does not open properly within the frame set.  
* The application now always checks if the current text or language still exist (could have sometimes resulted in empty query results after deleting).  
* New settings "Texts per Page", "Show Word Counts of Texts immediately", "Archived Texts per Page" and "Terms per Page". You can now define how many texts or terms are on one page. As the calculation of text word counts can slow down the loading of a long text table, you can switch off this calculation (and do the calculation later).  
    "New/Edit Term" now allow dictionary lookup (always in popup window). If you want to enter a term manually, you must first select the language on the "My Terms" page.

### Changed in 1.0.3

* Documentation and screenshots updated.  

## 1.0.2 (August 05 2011)

### Added in 1.0.2

* Language definition: If the searchword in the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) needs to be converted into a different encoding (standard is UTF-8), you can now use *###encoding###* as a placeholder. Example: *<http://mywebdict.com?q=###ISO-8859-15###>*. A list of encodings can be found [here](http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php) (omit the asterisk if one is at the end).

### Changed in 1.0.2

* Documentation and screenshots updated. Thai example added in demo database.  

## 1.0.1 (August 04 2011)

### Added in 1.0.1

* Empty database will be created automatically if database does not exist. Tables will be automatically recreated if some or all tables are missing. System handles (future) database changes automatically.  

### Changed in 1.0.1

* Testing: Last term tested will not show up immediately. Automatically selected sentences in tests now must not contain unsaved (blue) words. This does not apply if a sentence saved with a term contains unknown words - such sentences may come up within a test.
* Documentation and screenshots updated.  

## 1.0.0 (August 01 2011)

* First stable release. For some time, there won't be any new releases. I hope you'll understand that. Please post all problems, questions, and (hopefully not too many) bugs [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lwt/forums/forum/1813497), and ideas and suggestions for new features [here](http://lwt.uservoice.com). Thanks!  

## 0.9.8 (July 31 2011)

### Added in 0.9.8

* New Text Display Mode (see new checkbox on the "Read text" screen).  
  * \[Show All\] = ON (the only mode in previous releases): ALL terms are shown, and all multi-word terms are shown as superscripts before the first word. The superscript indicates the number of words in the multi-word term.  
  * \[Show All\] = OFF (new): Multi-word terms now hide single words and shorter or overlapping multi-word terms. This makes it easier to concentrate on multi-word terms while displaying them without superscripts, but creation and deletion of multi-word terms can be a bit slow in long texts.

### Changed in 0.9.8

* Documentation and screenshots updated.  

## 0.9.7 (July 28 2011)

### Changed in 0.9.7

* Internal improvements, status names, abbreviations, and tooltips (Thanks, Arthaey!). Printout of texts with optional inline annotation (translation and/or romanization) of terms that are of specified status(es). Documentation and screenshots corrected.  

## 0.9.6 (July 26 2011)

### Changed in 0.9.6

* More visual improvements (layout, tables, etc.), many improvements and bugfixes. Dictionary Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) use now ### as a placeholder for the searchword. If ### is missing, the searchword will be appended (like in older versions). More multi-actions for terms. Translation and sentence fields do NOT accept newlines anymore, now the form is submitted. Status entry changed from dropdown to radio buttons. Backup/Restore improved. CSS and XHTML corrected and validated. Korean example added. An Anki example deck is now provided: "LWT.anki" in directory "anki". Documentation and screenshots improved.  

## 0.9.5 (July 23 2011)

### Changed in 0.9.5

* Visual improvements (icons), a few bug fixes. Database Restore changed for bigger files. Two new tests to test L2 -> L1 or L1 -> L2 without sentence (just the term). The term filter operates not only on the term field but also on the romanization and translation field.  

## 0.9.4 (July 22 2011)

### Added in 0.9.4

* New buttons to switch easier between active texts and archived texts.  
* New settings "Testing: Number of sentences displayed from text, if available" and "Terms: Number of sentences generated from text, if available". Default is "Just ONE". The options "TWO (+ previous)" and "THREE (+ previous, + next)" now allow you to do MCD (Massive-Context Cloze Deletion) testing, as proposed by Khatzumoto @ AJATT.  

### Changed in 0.9.4

* "Import of terms" now only needs a translation if the status is set to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Furthermore it not only imports terms as TAB (ASCII 9) separated values (TSV) or "#" separated values, but also as comma separated values (CSV, strings in quotes ("...", if needed), a quote within a string as double quotes (""); this is the format that LingQ uses for exporting terms).
* Some minor bug fixes. Documentation updated.  

## 0.9.3 (July 21 2011)

### Fixed in 0.9.3

* After a lot of multi-platform/multi-server testing: several bug fixes and improvements. One severe bug that crashed importing and checking of texts on XAMPP/Win removed (Thanks, Kendall!). Within text, archive, and term queries, selected sort order will be retained (saved in database). All other query settings are now retained per session. Documentation updated.  

## 0.9.2 (July 19 2011)
