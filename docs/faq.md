# Questions and Answers

Answer: Your local webserver (Apache) is not running. Please start it via EasyPHP or MAMP control program/panel.  

## URL not found (404)

Answer: The server is running, but the application is not found. Maybe the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is wrong or misspelled. Please check/correct it. Or the URI is correct, and the application is installed, but not in the correct directory _lwt_ below _htdocs_. Please install/copy/move it into the correct directory.  

## Database connection error


![Image](../img/prob3.png)  

Answer: Either the database (MySQL) is not running, or the database connection parameters in _../htlwt/connect.inc.php_ are wrong. Please check/correct the database connection parameters and/or start MySQL via the MAMP or EasyPHP control program/panel.  

## Cannot find connect.inc.php

![Image](../img/prob4.png)  

Answer: The Webserver and the database is running, but the database connection parameter file _../htlwt/connect.inc.php_ is not found. Please rename one of the connection files (according to your server) to _../htlwt/connect.inc.php_.  

## Do not run on Linux after installation/update

If LWT installed or updated LWT on Linux, but the application does not run as expected.

Answer 1: The Webserver does not have full access to all LWT files (insufficient rights). Open a terminal window, go to the directory where the directory "lwt" has been created with all LWT files, e. g.  
**cd /var/www/html**  
Now execute:
**sudo chmod -R 755 lwt**.  

Answer 2: The PHP "mbstring" extension is not installed. Please install it: [see this article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/491629/how-to-install-php-mbstring-extension-in-ubuntu).
