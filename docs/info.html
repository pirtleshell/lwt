<blockquote>
<p><strong>THIS IS A THIRD PARTY VERSION</strong> - IT DIFFERS IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THE OFFICIAL LWT VERSION! See the <a href="info.html#newfeatures">new features</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Preface by lang-learn-guy (original author)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I started this software application in 2010 as a hobby project for my personal learning (reading &amp; listening to foreign texts, saving &amp; reviewing new words and expressions).</li>
<li>In June 2011, I decided to publish the software in the hope that it will be useful to other language learners around the world.</li>
<li>The software is 100 % free, open source, and in the public domain. You may do with it what you like: use it, improve it, change it, publish an improved version, even use it within a commercial product.</li>
<li>English is not my mother tongue - so please forgive me any mistakes.</li>
<li>A piece of software will be never completely free of "bugs" - please inform me of any problem you will encounter. Your feedback and ideas are always welcome.</li>
<li>My programming style is quite chaotic, and my software is mostly undocumented. This will annoy people with much better programming habits than mine, but please bear in mind that LWT is a one-man hobby project and completely free.</li>
<li>Thank you for your attention. I hope you will enjoy this application as I do every day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributions by HugoFara (GitHub  version maintainer)</h3>
<p>I started using LWT in 2021, and continued its development almost instantly. I felt that the core idea was very good, but its implementation seemed unnadapted, and the code was quite obfuscated. While I do not have any official responsibility to LWT (we don't have any kind of official agreement with lang-learn-guy), I am the the <em>de facto</em> maintainer of the community version. I dedicated myself to the following points (see the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/discussions/6">GitHub post</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Make LWT Open Source: document and refactor code</li>
<li>Meet the HTML5 standards: the interface was relying on deprecated systmes like frames, making it difficult to use on small screens.</li>
<li>Simplify users' lives: avoid complex installation or procedures whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you spot any problem, please post any <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues">issue on GitHub</a>, and we will look at it.</p>
<p>While work is not yet finished, I also aim to expand LWT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better UI: custom themes and better default appearance</li>
<li>Better UX: as of today (2022), 60 % of the web is done through mobile devices. It means less content at once and more intuitive behaviors.</li>
<li>Sounds: language learning is not just language reading.
<ul>
<li>Text-to-speech features.</li>
<li>Motivational sounds when testing terms to makes things more lively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there is much more! The community version of LWT is no longer the feat of one man, it belongs to everyone. As such, it gets well easier to implement new features, discuss and exchange code and ideas. I don't know if LWT contains <em>your</em> killer feature, but I can say that it <em>can be implemented</em> with this version. Enjoy!</p>

			<h2 id="abstract" name="abstract">▶ Abstract - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts/"><em>Learning with Texts</em> (LWT)</a> is a tool for Language Learning by reading texts.
It is inspired by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://sdkrashen.com">Stephen Krashen's</a> principles in Second Language Acquisition,</li>
<li>Steve Kaufmann's <a href="http://lingq.com">LingQ</a> System and</li>
<li>Ideas from Khatzumoto, published at <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com">"AJATT - All Japanese All The Time"</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You define languages you want to learn and import texts you want to use for learning. While listening to the optional audio, you read the text, save, review and test "terms" (words or multi word expressions, 2 to 9 words).</p>
<p>In new texts all your previously saved words and expressions are displayed according to their current learn statuses, tooltips show translations and romanizations (readings), editing, changing the status, dictionary lookup, etc. is just a click away.</p>
<p>Import of terms in TSV/CSV format, export in TSV format, and export to <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a> (prepared for cloze tests), are also possible.</p>
<p>To run LWT, you'll need:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>A modern web browser</strong>. Do not use Internet Explorer, any other browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge) should be fine.</li>
<li>
<strong>A local web server</strong>.
An easy way to install a local web server are preconfigured packages like
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">EasyPHP</a> or <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a> (Windows), or</li>
<li>
<a href="http://mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> (macOS), or</li>
<li>a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) server</a> (Linux).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The LWT Application</strong>. The latest version  <em>lwt_v_x_y.zip</em> can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip</a>.

			<h2 id="install" name="install">▶ LWT Installation - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Last update</em>: February 20, 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's install the LWT server. LWT uses a client-server architecture, which means it
will run in your browser as a classical website. You can use any computer as the
server, here are some ways to do it.</p>
<h3>A bird's-eye view</h3>
<p>Whatever installation you choose, the steps will look like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set-up a server with a database system.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases">LWT</a>.</li>
<li>Create <code>connect.inc.php</code> file with your password.</li>
<li>Start the server and ready to go!</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two main ways to install LWT: on your computer or using <a href="#run-in-a-docker-container">containers</a>. We recommend the first solution as the most straightforward. The second solution has a simpler installation method, but takes a lot of storage.</p>
<h3>Windows 10/11</h3>
<p>Two main softwares can be used to set up a local server on your computer: XAMPP and EasyPHP. We recommand XAMPP because it supports higher PHP version, but feel free to use any softare you like.</p>
<h4>Using XAMPP (recommended)</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install XAMPP</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html</a>
</li>
<li>Download "XAMPP for <strong>Windows</strong>". PHP starting from <strong>8.0</strong> is supported.</li>
<li>Open your Downloads folder and run the downloaded "xampp-windows-x64-xxx-installer.exe". Please install the components Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin into the folder C:\xampp.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases">latest GitHub release</a>, unzip it.</p>
<p>You can also try to download the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">latest stable version</a> if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now go into "C:\xampp\htdocs\lwt". Rename the file "connect_xampp.inc.php" to "connect.inc.php". Sometimes the "php" extension is hidden, so be careful! You can display file extensions via the Windows Explorer settings and check it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start LWT server</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the "XAMPP Control Panel" ("C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe") and start the two modules Apache and MySQL. Now the two module names should have a green background color.</li>
<li>LWT can now be started. Open a browser, and open <a href="http://localhost/lwt">http://localhost/lwt</a> (please bookmark).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may now define the first language you want to learn or install the LWT demo database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you start up Windows, you must repeat steps 4 and 5.</p>
<p>If you want to start "XAMPP Control Panel" every time you start Windows and to avoid Step 4.1, put a "XAMPP Control Panel" link to "C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe" into "C:\Users(YourUID)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup". To autostart also the Apache and MySQL modules, please open "Config" within the XAMPP Control Panel and check the two checkboxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: To fix a "XAMPP Control Panel" error "Xampp-control.ini Access is denied", please read and do the instructions in <a href="https://www.codermen.com/fix-xampp-server-error-xampp-control-ini-access-is-denied/">https://www.codermen.com/fix-xampp-server-error-xampp-control-ini-access-is-denied/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you must only do step 4.2 to start LWT.</p>
<h4>Using EasyPHP</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get Visual C++</p>
<ol>
<li>Download "vcredist_x86.exe" from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679</a>
</li>
<li>Choose the x86 version and download.</li>
<li>Run the installer "vcredist_x86.exe" in the Downloads folder.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get EasyPHP</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.easyphp.org/easyphp-devserver.php">https://www.easyphp.org/easyphp-devserver.php</a>
</li>
<li>Download "EasyPHP DevServer 17.0".</li>
<li>Open your Downloads folder and run the downloaded "EasyPHP-Devserver-17.0-setup.exe".</li>
<li>Install into "C:\Program Files (x86)\EasyPHP-Devserver-17".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases">latest GitHub release</a>, unzip it.</p>
<p>You can also try to download the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">latest stable version</a> if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install everything</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to "C:\Program Files (x86)\EasyPHP-Devserver-17\eds-www\lwt".</li>
<li>Rename the file "connect_easyphp.inc.php" to "connect.inc.php". Sometimes the "php" extension is hidden, so be careful! You can display file extensions via the Windows Explorer settings and check it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start EasyPHP</p>
<ol>
<li>Start EasyPHP via Desktop Icon (Devserver 17). In the Task Bar near the clock appears the EasyPHP app icon (it may be hidden!).</li>
<li>LWT can now be started. Right-Click on the EasyPHP icon in the taskbar, choose "Servers-&gt;Start/Restart all Servers", open a browser, and open <a href="http://127.0.0.1/lwt">http://127.0.0.1/lwt</a> (please bookmark).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may now define the first language you want to learn or install the LWT demo database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you start up EasyPHP, you must repeat step 5.1 and 5.2.</p>
<p>If you want to start EasyPHP every time you start Windows and avoid step 5.1, put an EasyPHP link into "C:\Users(YourUID)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup".</p>
<p>Now you must only do step 5.2 to start LWT.</p>
<h3>macOS 10.10+</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This section may be obsolete! Your help is welcome!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/">https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download "MAMP &amp; MAMP PRO" (currently version 6.6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double-click on the downloaded installation package "MAMP_MAMP_PRO_xxx.pkg", accept the license, click on "Install for all users..." and on "Continue", on the next panel titled "Standard Install on Macintosh HD" click on "Customize", deselect "MAMP PRO", and click Install. You must enter your password. After this step MAMP is installed within a folder named "MAMP" in the Applications folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases">latest GitHub release</a>, unzip it.</p>
<p>You can also try to download the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">latest stable version</a> if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to <code>/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/lwt</code>. Rename the file <code>connect_mamp.inc.php</code> to <code>connect.inc.php</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <code>MAMP.app</code> in <code>/Applications/MAMP</code>. Accept the messages from the firewall. Apache and MySQL start automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LWT can now be started in your web browser, go to: <a href="http://localhost:8888/lwt">http://localhost:8888/lwt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may define the first language you want to learn or install the LWT demo database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to use LWT again, just do steps 6 and 7.
The local webserver (MAMP) will be automatically stopped by quitting the MAMP application.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<h4>Using the Linux Installer</h4>
<p>We provide an installer that runs the commands described in the next section. To use the installer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases/latest">latest GitHub release</a>, unzip it.</li>
<li>Open a terminal in the downloaded folder, enable execution with <code>chmod +x ./INSTALL.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Run the script with <code>./INSTALL.sh</code>.</li>
<li>You can start using LWT at <a href="http://localhost/lwt">http://localhost/lwt</a>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Installing on Linux by hand</h4>
<p>The following instruction were tested on Raspbian Stretch.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal, type and execute the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Installation of LAMP:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php php php-mbstring php-mysql mysql-server
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Check if everything is okay:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>php -v</code> should show a PHP version equal or above to 8.0.0.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://locahlhost">http://locahlhost</a> should display a nice web page.</li>
<li>
<code>mysql -V</code> should work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable the extensions</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your PHP folder (<code>/etc/php/{{desired PHP version}}/{{PHP type}}/</code>)</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo nano php.ini</code>.</li>
<li>Delete the ";" symbols before <code>extension=mbstring</code> and <code>extension=mysqli</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set MySQL root Password to "abcxyz"</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo mysql
</code></pre>
<p>Then type</p>
<pre><code class="language-MySQL">ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'abcxyz';
FLUSH privileges;
QUIT; 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optionnal) Check MySQL access</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mysql -u root -p
abcxyz
</code></pre>
<p>If you see the MySQL prompt <code>mysql&gt;</code> after the first command, everything is OK. Quit with</p>
<pre><code class="language-MySQL">QUIT;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases">latest GitHub release</a>.</p>
<p>You can also try to download the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">latest stable version</a> if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unzip it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename the file <code>connect_xampp.inc.php</code> (in the unzipped folder) to <code>connect.inc.php</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit <code>connect.inc.php</code> and set the MySQL password in line
<code>$passwd = "";</code>. Change it to <code>$passwd = "abcxyz";</code>. Save the edited file connect.inc.php.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal, type and execute the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
sudo mv /[... Path to downloaded LWT ...]/lwt /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/lwt
sudo service apache2 restart
sudo service mysql restart
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>LWT can now be started in your web browser, go to: <a href="http://localhost/lwt">http://localhost/lwt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may install the LWT demo database, or define the first language you want to learn.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to use LWT again, just do step 7.</p>
<h3>Run in a Docker container</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> is the easiest way to install LWT, but it will use more or less 1 GB
on your system.</p>
<h4>Using the installer</h4>
<p>For an light-weight installation, you may use <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt-docker-installer">HugoFara/lwt-docker-installer</a>.</p>
<h4>Build image from source</h4>
<p>Download the lwt, open a terminal inside it, then type</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker compose up
</code></pre>
<p>By default the server can be accessed on port 8010 (<a href="http://localhost:8010">http://localhost:8010</a>).</p>
<p>To remove the created containers run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker compose down
</code></pre>
<h3>Dependency management with Composer</h3>
<p>If you have a technical knowledge of how Composer works for dependency management, you may consider using
Composer. It is <em>required for contributors only</em>, but advanced users may want to use it as well.
The official repository is at <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/hugofara/lwt">https://packagist.org/packages/hugofara/lwt</a>.</p>
<h3>Upgrade LWT</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Backup the LWT directory. Backup your database (within LWT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/releases">latest GitHub release</a>.</p>
<p>You can also try to download the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">latest stable version</a> if you want the cutting-edge updates (that may include some bugs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unzip it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the following (if not already at its place and OK) from your LWT backup into the LWT directory: "connect.inc.php" and the whole "media" sub-directory (if you created one; contains your MP3 audio files).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear the web browser cache and open LWT as usual.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>LWT is a all-in-one product, but you can extend its capabilities in various ways.
Here are the additional features unavailable by default.</p>
<h3>Parse Japanese with MeCab</h3>
<p><a href="https://taku910.github.io/mecab/">MeCab</a> is a Japanese parser. Installing it has
two main advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much better parsing of Japanese texts than RegExp.</li>
<li>Automatic romanization of words.</li>
<li>Unables text-to-speech for any character group.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<h4>Standard Installtion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions to download MeCab at <a href="https://taku910.github.io/mecab/#install">https://taku910.github.io/mecab/#install</a>.</li>
<li>Add MeCab to your system PATH.</li>
<li>In LWT, go to "Edit Languages" → "Japanese" and change from the value for "RegExp Word Characters" to <code>mecab</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Using Docker</h4>
<p>Original instructions provided <a href="https://nickramkissoon.medium.com/easily-set-up-and-use-mecab-with-docker-and-nodejs-5f01ae761a61">here</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Run your LWT container in interactive mode and install MeCab.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker exec -it lwt bash
apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y mecab libmecab-dev mecab-ipadic-utf8
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>In LWT, go to "Edit Languages" → "Japanese" and change from the value for "RegExp Word Characters" to <code>mecab</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Automatic Translation</h3>
<h4>LibreTranslate</h4>
<p><a href="https://libretranslate.com/">LibreTranslate</a> is a great open-source tool that allows you to translate text and provides an API.
With it you can achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation of sentences without using Google Translate.</li>
<li>Automatic translation of words (so you don't need to fill by hand!).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/libretranslate_demo.png" alt="LibreTranslate Demo"></p>
<p>To use it, please read the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate#install-and-run">Install it</a> on a local or remote server or using Docker.</li>
<li>In LWT, go to "Edit Langagues", either create a new or edit an existing language</li>
<li>In the field "Sentence Translator URI", replace it by the URL of you libre translate instance.
<ul>
<li>Do not forget to add the parameter <code>lwt_translator=libretranslate</code> for the automatic translation!</li>
<li>
<code>source=</code> should be followed by two letters indicating the language translating from.</li>
<li>
<code>target=</code> should be followed by two letters indicating the language to translate to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Enhanced Text-to-Speech</h3>
<p>The Text-to-Speech may sound robotic with some languages or operating systems. A
workaround is to download a Text-To-Speech (TTS) plugin such as <a href="https://readaloud.app/">Read Aloud</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="features" name="features">▶ Features - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>You define languages you want to learn.</li>
<li>You define the web dictionaries you want to use.</li>
<li>You define how sentences and words in the language will be split up.</li>
<li>You upload texts, and they are automatically split into sentences and words! Later re-parsing is possible.</li>
<li>Optional: Assign the URL of an mp3 audio file of the text (Dropbox, local server, ...) in order to listen while reading the text.</li>
<li>You read the text while listening to the audio, and you see immediately the status of every word (unknown, learning, learned, well-known, ignored).</li>
<li>You click on words, and you use the external dictionaries to find out their meanings.</li>
<li>You save words or expressions (2..9 words) with optional romanization (for asiatic languages), translations and example sentence, you change its status, you edit them whenever needed (like in LingQ).</li>
<li>You test your understanding of words and expressions within or without sentence context.</li>
<li>MCD (Massive-Context Cloze Deletion) testing, as proposed by Khatzumoto @ AJATT, built-in!</li>
<li>See your progress on the statistics page.</li>
<li>You may export the words and expressions and use them in Anki or other programs.</li>
<li>You may upload words and expressions into LWT (from LingQ or other sources, CSV/TSV) - they are immediately available in all texts!</li>
<li>
<strong>New since Version 1.5.0:</strong> Create and edit an improved annotated text version (a <a href="http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperliteral_translations">hyperliteral translation</a> as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinear_gloss">interlinear text</a>) for online or offline learning. Read more <a href="info.html#il">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>The application is 100 % free, open source, and in the Public Domain. Do with it what you like!</li>
<li>Prerequisites: a local webserver (Apache, PHP, mySQL), e.g. EasyPHP or XAMPP (Windows), MAMP (macOS), or a LAMP server (Linux).</li>
<li>Enjoy your language learning!</li>
</ul>

			<h2 id="newfeatures" name="newfeatures">▶ New feature not available in the official LWT - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mobile support, responsive design</li>
<li>Support for different themes</li>
<li>Display translations of terms with status in the reading frame</li>
<li>Much better interface for the main menu</li>

<li>Multiwords selection (click and hold on a word → move to another word → release mouse button)</li>
<li>Key bindings work when you hover over a word</li>
<li>Bulk translate new words in the reading frame</li>
<li>New key bindings in the reading frame:
<ul>
<li>T (translate sentence),</li>
<li>P (pronounce term),</li>
<li>G (edit term with Google Translate)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to change audio playback speed (doesn't work when using the flash plugin)</li>
<li>Improved HTML organization. It has several effect:

<li>Automatically import texts from RSS feeds (for more info see: <a href="info.html#feed_imp">Newsfeed Import</a>)</li>
<li>Longer (&gt; 9 characters) expressions can now be saved (up to 250 characters)</li>
<li>Improved Search/Query for Words/Texts</li>
<li>Selecting terms according to a text tag</li>
<li>Term import with more options (i.e.: combine translations, multiple tag import,...)</li>
<li>Two database backup modes (new or old structure)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Back-end</h3>
<ul>
<li>Native support for Docker</li>
<li>Database improvements: the database takes much less space on the server</li>
<li>Better caching due to an improved file management</li>
<li>Enhanced security and robustness due do sanitazed SQL inputs</li>
</ul>

			<h2 id="learn" name="learn">▶ How to Learn - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p>First, find a text you want to study, preferably with an audio file, and load it into LWT. The <a href="http://lingq.com">LingQ Library</a> has many texts with audio, and only a free registration is needed. Or look into <a href="https://www.lingq.com/en/forum/updates-tips-and-known-issues/where-to-find-good-content-to-import/">this thread</a> in the LingQ Forum, you will find there lots of great links to resources. Or click (within the LingQ library) on "My Imports" - you will find a list of links of "Suggested resources".</p>
<p>Read the text, look up the new words and expressions (=terms) and save them for review and test. The good thing with LWT: Every saved term will show up with its translation, status, etc. in all other occurrences of the same text and every other text! So you'll see immediately what you already know and how well you know it. And of course you'll see what you don't know!</p>
<p>Train: load the MP3 file also on your portable MP3 player and listen to it often. Review (by reading again) or test your saved words and expressions.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen ▶ Read ▶ Review/Test.</li>
<li>Listen ▶ Read ▶ Review/Test.</li>
<li>......</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. It's that simple. You can also watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lingosteve">Steve Kaufmann's videos on YouTube</a>: "The 7 secrets of language learning", "Language learning FAQ", and many more to learn more eficiently.</p>

			<h2 id="howto" name="howto">▶ How to Use - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<h3>Home Screen</h3>
<p>LWT home screen after installation:</p>
<p><img src="../img/23.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>This is home screen of LWT if the database is empty. Please install the demo database or start with the definition of a language you want to learn.</p>
<p>LWT home screen</p>
<p><img src="../img/lwt_home_screen.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>This is normal home screen of LWT. You may choose a language here, but you can do this also later. If you you choose a language, the language filter is pre-set to that language in some other screens. The last text you've read or tested is shown, and you may jump directly into reading, testing or printing of this last text.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>The list of languages. Here you can add a new or edit an existent language. If no texts and no saved terms in a language exist, you can delete a language. If you change a language, all texts may be automatically reparsed to refresh (and correct) the cache of sentences and text items (depends on what language settings you have changed). You can do this also manually by clicking on the yellow flash icon. You can also test all (due) terms of a language or set a language as "current" language.</p>
<p><img src="../img/02.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h4>New/Edit Language</h4>
<p>This is the place to define or edit a language you want to study.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the "Language Settings Wizard" first. You only select your
native (L1) and study (L2) languages, and let the wizard set all language settings
that are marked in yellow. You can always adjust the settings afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Explanations of the input fields</strong> - please read also <a href="info.html#langsetup">this section</a>:</p>
<p>The three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> are URLs to three web dictionaries (the second and third is optional). Use <code>lwt_term</code> as a placeholder for the search word in the URIs. If <code>lwt_term</code> is missing, the search word will be appended to the end. If the URI to query "travailler" in WordReference is "http://www.wordreference.com/fren/travailler", you may enter: "http://www.wordreference.com/fren/lwt_term" or "http://www.wordreference.com/fren/". Another example: The URI to query "travailler" in sensagent is "http://dictionary.sensagent.com/travailler/fr-en/", so you enter in LWT "http://dictionary.sensagent.com/lwt_term/fr-en/".</p>
<p>As URI No. 3 ("Translator") is also used to translate whole sentences. It is recommended to use either <a href="https://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a> or <a href="https://libretranslate.com/">LibreTranslate</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generic URL for Google Translate: "http://translate.google.com/?ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=..&amp;tl=..&amp;text=lwt_term", where the two-character codes after "sl=" and "tl=" designate the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">language codes (or "subtags")</a> for the source and the target language.</li>
<li>Generic URL for LibreTranslate: "http://localhost:5000/?lwt_translator=libretranslate&amp;source=..&amp;target=..&amp;q=lwt_term".
<ul>
<li>Use "source=" and "target=" to set languages.</li>
<li>It is <strong>required</strong> to set "lwt_translator=libretranslate" if you want to use automatic translation features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A different third web dictionary is of course possible, but sentence translations may not work.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Some dictionaries (including "Google Translate") don't allow to be opened within a frame set. Put an asterisk * in front of the URI (Examples: *<a href="http://mywebdict.com?q=###">http://mywebdict.com?q=###</a> or *<a href="http://translate.google.com/?ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=..&amp;tl=..&amp;text=###)">http://translate.google.com/?ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=..&amp;tl=..&amp;text=###)</a> to open such a dictionary not within the frame set but in a popup window (please don't forget to deactivate popup window blocking in your browser!).</p>
<h5>Deprecated Features</h5>
<h6>Specify Encoding</h6>
<p><strong>This feature has been abandonned, do not use it</strong>!</p>
<p>If the searchword in the three URIs needs to be converted into a different encoding (standard is UTF-8), you could use ###encoding### as a placeholder. Normally you see this right away if terms show up wrongly in the web dictionary. Example: Linguee expects the searchword in ISO-8859-15, not in UTF-8, so you define it this way: "http://www.linguee.de/search?direction=auto&amp;query=###ISO-8859-15###". A list of encodings can be found <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php">here</a>.</p>
<h6>Glosbe API</h6>
<p>Glosbe closed there API, this feature does no longer work.</p>
<p>One dictionary (<a href="http://glosbe.com/">Glosbe</a>) has been closely integrated into LWT via the Glosbe API. To use this dictionary, input the "special" dictionary link "http://localhost/lwt/glosbe_api.php?from=...&amp;dest=...&amp;phrase=lwt_term_" with <em>from</em>: "L2 language code" (the language of your texts) and <em>dest</em>: "L1 language code" (e.g. mother tongue). To find the language codes, open <a href="http://glosbe.com/all-languages">this page</a> to select the "from" (L2) language. On the next page, select the "L2 - L1" language pair. The URL of the next page shows the two language codes, here as an example "French - English": <a href="http://glosbe.com/**fr**/**en**/">http://glosbe.com/**fr**/**en**/</a>. The "from" code is "fr", the "dest" code is "en". Using this dictionary makes the transfer of translation(s) from the Glosbe to LWT very easy: just click on the icon next to the translations to copy them into the LWT edit screen. I recommend to use the LWT-integrated Glosbe dictionary as the "Dictionary 1 URI". Note: I cannot guarantee that the Glosbe API and this special integration will work in the future! glosbe_api.php is just an example how one can integrate a dictionary into LWT.</p>

<p>If you have found a suitable web dictionary, try to translate some words and look whether the word is part of the web address (URI/URL). If yes, replace the word with ### and put this in one of the URI fields within LWT.</p>
<p>The entry "Text Size" defines the relative font size of the text. This is great for Chinese, etc.</p>
<p>"Character Substitutions" is an optional list of "from=to" items with "|" as list separator. The "from" character is replaced by the "to" character ("to" may be also empty). So different kinds of apostrophes can unified or deleted.</p>
<p>"RegExp Split Sentences" is a list of characters that signify a sentence ending (ALWAYS together with a following space or newline!). The space can be omitted (and it is normally), if you set "Make each character a word" to Yes (see below). Whether you include here ":" and ";" - that's your decision. See also <a href="info.html#langsetup">this table</a>. Characters can be also defined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> form: "\x{....}"; the Chinese/Japanese full stop "。" is then "\x{3002}" (always without "). Please inform yourself about Unicode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">here (general information)</a> and <a href="http://unicode.coeurlumiere.com/">here (Table of Unicode characters)</a>.</p>
<p>"Exceptions Split Sentences" are a list of exceptions that are NOT to be treated as sentence endings with "|" as list separator. [A-Z] is a character range. If you don't want to split sentences after Mr. / Dr. / A. to Z. / Vd. / Vds. / U.S.A., then you should specify these here: "Mr.|Dr.|[A-Z].|Vd.|Vds.|U.S.A." (without ").</p>
<p>"RegExp Word Characters" is a list of characters OR character ranges "x-y" that defines all characters in a word, e.g. English: "a-zA-Z", German: "a-zA-ZaöüÄÖÜß", Chinese: 一-龥. See also <a href="info.html#langsetup">this table</a>. Characters can be also defined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> form: "\x{....}"; the Chinese/Japanese character "one" "一" is then "\x{4E00}" (always without "). So the above specification for the range of characters in Chinese "一-龥" can also be specified: "\x{4E00}-\x{9FA5}".</p>
<ul>
<li>The value "mecab" is special as it will use MeCab to process japanese. You can ignore subsequent fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Make each character a word" is a special option for Chinese, etc. This makes EVERY character a single word (normally words are split by any non-word character or a space). See also <a href="info.html#langsetup">this table</a>.</p>
<p>"Remove spaces" is another option for Chinese, etc. It removes all spaces from the text (and the example sentences). See also <a href="info.html#langsetup">this table</a>.</p>
<p>"Right-To-Left Script" must be set to "Yes" if the language/script is written from right to left, like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu, etc.</p>
<p>"Export Template". The export template controls "Flexible" Term Exports for the terms of that language. It consists of a string of characters. Some parts of this string are placeholders that are replaced by the actual term data, <a href="export_template.html">see this table</a>. For each term (word or expression), that has been selected for export, the placeholders of the export template will be replaced by the term data and the string will be written to the export file. If the export template is empty, nothing will be exported.</p>
<p>To understand all these options, please study also <a href="info.html#langsetup">this</a>, look at the examples and play around with different settings and different texts.</p>
<p><img src="../img/language_edition.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Texts</h3>
<p>The list of texts. You can filter this list according to language, title (wildcard = *) or text tag(s) (see also below). The most important links for each text are "Read" and "Test" - that's the place to read, to listen, to save terms and to review and test your terms in sentence context. To see all terms of a text that you have saved, click on the numbers in column "Saved Wo+Ex". To print, archive, edit (and reparse), or to delete a text, click on the icons in column "Actions". There are more actions available, see "Multi Actions".</p>
<p><img src="../img/04.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h4>Multi Actions for marked texts</h4>
<p>You can test the terms of the marked texts, delete or archive the marked texts. "Reparse Texts" rebuilds the sentence and the text item cache for all marked texts. "Set Term Sentences" sets a valid sentence (with the term in {..}) for all those saved or imported terms that occur in the text and that do not have a sentence at all or none with {term}. This makes it easy to "create" sentence examples for imported terms.</p>
<p><img src="../img/14.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Text Tags</h3>
<p>The list of your text tags. You can manage your text tags here. With text tags, it will be easier to categorize and organize your texts. The tags are case sensitive, have 1 to 20 characters, and must not contain any spaces or commas.</p>
<p><img src="../img/25.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h4>New/Edit Text</h4>
<p>This is the screen to input, check or edit a single text. Try to store not too long texts (the maximum length is 65,000 Bytes). If texts are very long (&gt; 1000 words), certain operations (e.g. loading a text for reading, calculation of known/unknown words) may be quite slow. An audio URI and a link to the text source can also be defined. The best place to store your audios is the "media" subdirectory below the installation directory "lwt" (you have to create it yourself, and you have to copy the audio files into this directory; click Refresh if you don't see just copied media). But a cloud webspace service like DropBox is also possible. In the moment there is no possibility to import/upload an audio file within the LWT application. By the way, you can use MP3, WAV, or OGG media files, but be aware that not all browsers and/or operating systems support all media types!</p>
<p>If you click "Check", the text will be parsed and split into sentences and words according to your language settings. Nothing will be stored if you check a text. You can see whether your text needs some editing, or whether your language settings (especially the ones that influence parsing/splitting) need an adjustment. Words (not expressions) that are already in your word list are displayed in red, and the translation is displayed. The Non-Word List shows all stuff between words. The "Check a Text" function can also be started directly from the main menu. If you click on "Change" or "Save", the text will be only saved. If you click on "Change and Open" or "Save and Open", the text will be saved and opened right away.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>You can also import a longer text into LWT with the possibility to split it up into several smaller texts. Click on "Long Text Import". You must specify the maximum number of sentences per text, and the handling of newlines for paragraph detection. It is not possible to specify audio files or URIs.</p>
<p><img src="../img/33.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Newsfeed</h3>
<h4>Newsfeed Import</h4>
<p>Here you can download the articles of your newsfeeds (HowTo add a new newsfeed see <a href="info.html#new_feed">here</a>). If you've set up multiple newsfeeds for your selected language, the link "update multiple feeds" will appear. By clicking that link you can update one or more feeds at once. If you've selected a newsfeed, a blue circle-arrow will appear as well as the date of your last update. A click on the circle-arrow will update your selected newsfeed. All downloaded articles will be marked by a bookmark-icon instead of the checkbox, so you can access them immediately. If a downloaded article is archived, a red mark will appear. An error may occur, when you try to download an article and the link or the text-section of the article is not found. Then a yellow warning sign appears, which can be removed temporarily by clicking on it or permanently in <a href="info.html#man_feed">Manage Feeds</a>. If you hover over an article title, a description of the article will be shown. You can open the article and, if available, the audio in a new window.</p>
<p><img src="../img/37.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h4>Manage Feeds</h4>
<p>Multi Actions for marked newsfeeds: You can update feeds, unset unloadable articles (see <a href="info.html#feed_imp">my newsfeeds</a>), delete all articles or delete feeds.<br>
Actions: You can edit, update, delete a feed or follow the link to the newsfeed.</p>
<p><img src="../img/38.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h4>New/Edit Feeds</h4>
<p>Explanations of the input fields</p>
<ul>
<li>Language: select your language, it can be changed later.</li>
<li>Name: the name is limited to 40 characters, this field must not be empty.</li>
<li>Newsfeed url: URL of your RSS/Atom-Feed, this field must not be empty.</li>
<li>Article Section: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/">xpath expression</a> (i.e.: //div[@id="content-to-read"]/p), the <a href="info.html#feed_wizard">feed wizard</a> can be used to get the right sections, this field must not be empty.</li>
<li>Filter Tags: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/">xpath expression</a>, the <a href="info.html#feed_wizard">feed wizard</a> can be used to get the right sections.</li>
<li>Options:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Edit Text: if this is checked, you can edit your articles before saving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto Update Interval: your feed will be updated automatically, when you enter MY FEEDS from the main menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max. Links: number of shown in MY FEEDS, if this is empty, the value in the settings will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charset: this should be empty, charset sould be detected automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max. Texts: max. number of active texts, if this is empty, the value in the settings will be used. Older texts will be moved into ARCHIVE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tag: you can give the texts a tag, if this is empty, the first 20 characters of the feed name will be used. The tag will be used to move the older texts into ARCHIVE. Each feed should have its own tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Article Source: some feeds have its texts integrated in the description. The articles can be cached in the database, which results in a faster download and a bigger database. Feeds with cached articles should have less Max. Links. The feed wizard can be used to detect the Article Source. If this is unchecked, each article will be downloaded from the internet.</p>
<p><img src="../img/41.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Feed Wizard</h4>
<p>Here you can edit or set up a new newsfeed in 4 steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert your newsfeed url. This step is skipped, when you edit a newsfeed.</li>
<li>Step 2</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name: the name is limited to 40 characters, this can be changed later in step 4 and must not be empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newsfeed url: URL of your RSS/Atom-Feed, this can only be changed in step 1 and must not be empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Article Source: Webpage Link means, that the article will downloaded from the link, all other values mean, that the texts are cached in the database, when you update your feed. You must set the value, before you set the article section. This can only be changed here.</p>
<p><strong>How to select the article section:</strong></p>
<p>When you click on the text, it will be marked yellow and a value in the right selectbox will appear. You can change the marked section by selecting a value. If you click on the yellow marked text, the text will be unmarked. To select a text click the "get"-button. The xpath expression of the selected text will then appear on the top and the text will be marked green. You can unselect the selected text by clicking on the red cross. If you click on the xpath expression or on the selected text, a border around the selected text will appear. This can be used to verify the connection between text and xpath exp. in the articles. In order to change an article/webpage use the selectbox on the left. All visited articles start with an arrow "▶". Articles from different hosts probably contain different article sections. Therefore a selectbox can be used to mark the hosts, that are "done", with a star. By clicking on the setting icon, you can choose between three selection modes. "Smart Selection" looks for ids and classes in the element node and parent node. "Get All Attributes" will compare all attributes of the element node/parent node with the text. This mode is not recommended. "Advanced Selection" lets you customize the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/">xpath expression</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/39.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>This works like step 2. Only the selected sections from step 2 are clickable. Marked text will appear grey, filtered texts will have a red font.</p>
<p><img src="../img/40.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The settings are explained in <a href="#new_feed">New/Edit Feeds</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Read a Text</h3>
<p>This is your "working area": Reading (and listening to) a text, saving/editing words and expressions, looking up words, expressions, sentences in external dictionaries or Google Translate. To create an expression, click on the first word. You see "Exp: 2..xx 3..yy 4..zz ...". Just click on the number of words (2..9) of the desired expression you want to save. The dictionary links for multi word expressions are always in the edit frame! You can also use the Keyboard in the text frame, see <a href="info.html#keybind">Key Bindings</a>. Double clicking on a word sets the audio position approximately to the text position, if an audio was defined. The other audio controls are self-explanatory: automatic repeat, rewind and move forward n seconds, etc.).</p>
<p><img src="../img/06.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Reading a Right-To-Left Script (Hebrew):</p>
<p><img src="../img/26.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>With the checkbox [Show All] you can switch the display of text:</p>
<p>[Show All] = ON (see below): All terms are shown, and all multi-word terms are shown as superscripts before the first word. The superscript indicates the number of words in the multi-word term.</p>
<p><img src="../img/22.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>[Show All] = OFF (see below): Multi-word terms now hide single words and shorter or overlapping multi-word terms. This makes it easier to concentrate on multi-word terms while displaying them without superscripts, but creation and deletion of multi-word terms can be a bit slow in long texts.</p>
<p><img src="../img/30.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Test terms</h3>
<p>Tests are only possible if a term has a translation. Terms with status "Ignored" and "Well Known" are never tested, and terms with a positive or zero score are not tested today. In summary, the term score must fall below zero to trigger the test. See also <a href="info.html#termscores">Term scores</a>. Terms that are due today are marked with a red bullet in the term table. Terms that are due tomorrow are marked with a yellow bullet in the term table.</p>
<p>During a test, a status display (at the bottom of the test frame) shows you the elapsed time "mm:ss", a small bar graph, and the total, not yet tested, wrong and correct terms in this test.</p>
<p>In the following, L1 denotes you mother tongue (= translations), and L2 the language you want to learn (= the terms (words and expressions).</p>
<p><strong>Test terms in a text (L2 -&gt; L1)</strong></p>
<p>This is Test #1 or #4: L2 -&gt; L1 (recognition) - to train your ability to recognize a L2 term. You may test within sentence context (Button "..[L2].."), or just the term (Button "[L2]"). You can also use the Keyboard in the test frame, see <a href="info.html#keybind">Key Bindings</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/07.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><strong>Test terms in a text (L1 -&gt; L2)</strong></p>
<p>This is Test #2 or #5: L1 -&gt; L2 (recall) - to train your ability to produce a term from L1. You may test within sentence context (Button "..[L1].."), or just the term (Button "[L1]"). You can also use the Keyboard in the test frame, see <a href="info.html#keybind">Key Bindings</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/11.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><strong>Test terms in a text (••• -&gt; L2)</strong></p>
<p>This is test #3: ••• -&gt; L2 (recall) - to train your ability to produce a term only from the sentence context (Button "..[••].."). If you hover over "[•••]", a tooltip displays the translation of the term. You can also use the Keyboard in the test frame, see <a href="info.html#keybind">Key Bindings</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/12.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><strong>Test yourself in a table / word list format (Button "Table")</strong></p>
<p>This is test #6: The selected terms and expressions are presented as a table. You can make invisible either the columns "Term" or "Translation", and you can hide or show the columns "Sentence", "Romanization", "Status" and "Ed" (Edit). To reveal the invisible solution ("Term" or "Translation"), you just click into the empty table cell. You can review or test yourself with or without changing the status by clicking "+" or "-" in the "Status" column. A status in red signifies that the term is due for testing. You can also edit the term by clicking the yellow "Edit" icon. Columns 2 to 6 may also my sorted by clicking on the header row. The initial sort order is according to term score.</p>
<p><img src="../img/32.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Print a text</h3>
<p>Here you print a text. Optional: an inline annotation (translation and/or romanization) of terms that are of specified status(es). This screen is also great to just read or study a text.</p>
<p>Chinese Text with annotation (Romanization/Pinyin and translation):</p>
<p><img src="../img/20.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Chinese Text with annotation (only Romanization/Pinyin):</p>
<p><img src="../img/21.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Create, edit, and use an Improved Annotated Text</h3>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Annotated texts (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinear_gloss">interlinear text</a>) have been used for language learning for a long time. One example are the word-by-word translations in <a href="http://en.assimil.com/">Assimil</a> courses. The German <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070223080453/http://195.149.74.241/BIRKENBIHL/PDF/MethodEnglish.pdf">V. F. Birkenbihl</a> proposes the creation of interlinear word-by-word or <a href="http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperliteral_translations">hyperliteral</a> translations (calling this creation "decoding") in foreign language learning. Learning Latin or Ancient Greek via interlinear texts is quite old as you can see in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnEKnezLXJg">this YouTube video</a>.</p>
<p>LWT's old "Print Screen" offers annotations, but it displays ALL translations of a term. The <em>Improved Annotated Text</em> feature enables you to select the best translation for every word in the text. As a result, you create an L1 word-by-word translation that is displayed above the L2 text. This interlinear text is better suited for language study, especially for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> While listening to the audio, first follow the blue annotations in your native language while listening and understanding. Later, after understanding the text fully, you read the foreign language text alone. Repeat this often. After these steps, you listen to the text passively or do shadowing.</p>
<p>On the Print Screen, click on "Create" an Improved Annotated Text. The system creates a default annotated text.</p>
<h4>Edit Mode</h4>
<p><img src="../img/28.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Within the "Improved Annotated Text - Edit Mode", you can select the best term translation by clicking on one of the radio buttons. To be able to do this, multiple translations must be delimited by one of the delimiters specified in the LWT Settings (currently: /;|). You can also type in a new translation into the text box at the end (this does not change your saved term translation), or you may change your term by clicking on the yellow icon or add a translation by clicking on the green "+" icon (this does change your saved term translation), and select it afterwards. The "Star" icon indicated that you want the term itself as annotation. <strong>Important:</strong> It's not possible to create new terms here - please do this in the "Read text" screen. Changing the language settings (e.g. the word characters) may have the effect that you have to start from scratch. The best time for the creation of an improved annotated text is after you have read the text completely and created all terms and expressions in the "Read text" screen.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the text, you will lose the saved improved annotated text! All changes in the Edit screen are saved automatically in the background!</p>
<p>To leave the Edit mode, click on "Display/Print Mode". You may then print or display (with audio) the text, and work with the text online or offline.</p>
<h4>Print Mode</h4>
<p><img src="../img/27.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h4>Display Mode</h4>
<p>With audio player in a separate window. Clicking the "T" or "A" lightbulb icons hides/shows the text or the blue annotations. You may also click on a single term or a single annotation to show or to hide it. This enables you to test yourself or to concentrate on one text only. Romanizations, if available, appear while hovering over a term.</p>
<p><img src="../img/29.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Terms</h3>
<p>The list of your saved words or expressions (= terms). You may filter the list of terms by language, text, status, term/romanization/translation (wildcard * possible) or term tag(s). Different sort orders are possible. You can do "multi actions" only on the marked or on all terms (on all pages!). "Se?" displays a green dot if a valid sentences with {term} exists. "Stat/Days" displays the status and the number of days since the last status change. The score of a term is a rough measure (in percent) how well you know a term. Read more about term scores <a href="info.html#termscores">here</a>. Terms with zero score are displayed red and should be tested today.</p>
<p><img src="../img/08.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><strong>Multi Actions for marked terms</strong></p>
<p>Most actions are self-explanatory. "Test Marked Terms" starts a test with all marked terms. You may delete marked terms and change the status of marked terms. "Set Status Date to Today" is some kind of "trick" for vacations, illnesses, etc.</p>
<p>"Export Marked Texts (Anki)" exports all terms that have been marked AND have a valid sentence with {term} for Anki. Terms that do not have a sentence with {term} will NOT be exported. Cloze testing of terms within sentence context can so be easily done in Anki. The export is tab-delimited: (1) term, (2) translation, (3) romanization, (4) Sentence without term (question of cloze test), (5) Sentence with term (answer of cloze test), (6) Language, (7) ID Number, (8) Tag list. Anki template decks (for Anki Version 1 and 2) are provided: "LWT.anki" and "LWT.apkg" in directory "anki".</p>
<p>"Export Marked Texts (TSV)" exports all terms that have been marked. The export is tab-delimited: (1) term, (2) translation, (3) sentence, (4) romanization, (5) status, (6) language, (7) ID Number, (8) tag list.</p>
<p><img src="../img/16.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p><strong>Multi Actions for all terms on all pages of the current query</strong></p>
<p>Explanations see above.</p>
<p><img src="../img/17.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Term Tags</h3>
<p>The list of your term tags. You can manage your term tags here. With term tags, it will be easier to categorize and organize your terms. The tags are case sensitive, have 1 to 20 characters, and must not contain any spaces or commas.</p>
<p><img src="../img/24.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Text Archive</h3>
<p>The list of archived texts. To unarchive, to edit or to delete a text, click on the icon under "Actions". There are also "Multi Actions" available.</p>
<p>What is the difference between (active) texts and archived texts?</p>
<p><strong>(Active) texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have been parsed and tokenized according to the rules defined for the language.</li>
<li>The result is stored in a cache of sentences and text items.</li>
<li>They use a lot of space in the database.</li>
<li>Reading with term creation/editing and dictionary lookup is possible.</li>
<li>Testing of a stored term that occurs in the text, is possible. A terms will be tested within the context of any sentence(s) in all active texts (the number of sentences may be set (1, 2, or 3) as a preference).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Archived texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are not parsed and tokenized, only the text is stored.</li>
<li>Compared with active texts, they don't use much space in the database, because no sentences and no text items are stored.</li>
<li>Reading with term creation/editing and dictionary lookup is not possible.</li>
<li>Testing of a stored term, that occurs in the text, is possible, but a term will be tested ONLY within the context of the sentence(s) that has/have been stored with the term in the sentence field, if the term does not occur in any active text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>It's self-explanatory and shows your performance. The numbers in the first table are links, by clicking on them you jump to the table of all terms in that status and language.</p>
<p><img src="../img/09.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Import Terms</h3>
<p>Import a list of terms for a language, and set the status for all to a specified value. You can specify a file to upload or type/paste the data directly into the textbox. Format: one term per line, fields (columns) are separated either by comma ("CSV" file, e.g. used in LingQ as export format), TAB ("TSV" file, e.g. copy and paste from a spreadsheet program, not possible if you type in data manually) or # (if you type in data manually). The field/column assignment must be specified on the left.</p>
<p>Important: You must import a term. The translation can be omitted if the status should be set to 98 or 99 (ignore/well known). Translation, romanization and sentence are all optional, but please understand that tests are only possible if terms have a translation. If a term already exists in the database (comparison is NOT case sensitive), it will not be overwritten; the line will be ignored. You can change this by setting "Overwrite existent terms" to "Yes". Be careful using this screen, a database backup before the import and double-checking everything is always advisable!</p>
<p><img src="../img/upload_terms.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p>This screen offers a possibility to save, restore or empty the LWT database (ONLY the current table set!). This makes it easy to try out new things or just to make regular backups. "Restore" only accepts files that have been created with the "Backup" function above. "Empty Database" deletes the data of all tables (except the settings) of the current table set, and you can start from scratch afterwards. Be careful: you may lose valuable data!</p>
<p><img src="../img/18.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>In this screen you can adjust the program according to your needs. The geometric properties of the <em>Read Text</em> and <em>Test</em> screens can be changed. This is important because different browsers and font sizes may result in an unpleasant viewing experience.</p>
<p>The waiting time to display the next test and to hide the old message after a test assessment can be changed.</p>
<p>The number of sentences displayed during testing and generated during term creation can be set to 1 (default), 2 or 3; if set to 2 or 3 you are able to do "MCD" (Massive-Context Cloze Deletion) testing, proposed by Khatzumoto @ AJATT.</p>
<p>The number of items per page on different screens can be set, and you can decide whether you want to see the word counts on the textpage immediately (page may load slow) or later (faster initial loading).</p>
<p><img src="../img/19.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<h3>Multiple LWT table sets</h3>
<p><strong>WARNINGS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of the "Multiple LWT table sets" feature on an external web server may cause a <strong>monstrous database size</strong> if some users import many or large texts. LWT with activated "Multiple LWT table sets" is in its current version <strong>not suitable</strong> to be run in a public environment on an external web server!</li>
<li>Another better system may be implemented, use this feature at your own risks!</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start using LWT, you store all your data in the "Default Table Set" within the database you have defined in the file "connect.inc.php" during the LWT installation.</p>
<p>Beginning with LWT Version 1.5.3, you are able to create and to use unlimited LWT table sets within one database (as space and MySQL limitations permit). This feature is especially useful for users who want to set up a multi user environment with a set of tables for each user. You can also create one table set for every language you study - this allows you to create different term/text tags for each language. If you don't need this feature, you just use LWT like in earlier versions with the "default table set". Please observe that the "Backup/Restore/Empty Database" function only works for the CURRENT table set, NOT for ALL table sets you have created!</p>
<p>Just click on the link at the bottom of the LWT home screen where the current table set name (or "Default") is displayed. In a new screen "Select, Create or Delete a Table Set" you may switch and manage table sets. A table set name is max. 20 characters long. Allowed characters are only: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the underscore "_".</p>
<p><img src="../img/31.jpg" alt="Image"></p>
<p>If you want "switch off" this feature, and use just one table set, you may define the name in the file "connect.inc.php":</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$tbpref = "";          // only the default table set  
$tbpref = "setname";   // only the table set "setname"  
</code></pre>
<p>After adding such a line in the file "connect.inc.php", you are not able to select, create or delete table sets anymore. Only the one you have defined in "connect.inc.php" will be used. Please observe the rules for table set names (see above)!</p>
<p>If more than one table set exists, and $tbpref was NOT set to a fixed value in "connect.inc.php", you can select the desired table set via "start.php" (use this as start page if several people use their own table set), or by clicking on the LWT icon or title in the LWT menu screen "index.php".</p>
<p>By hovering over the LWT icon in the top left corner of every screen, you can display the current table set in a yellow tooltip.</p>

<h3>Site Unreachable</h3>
<p>If you see "The webpage is not available", "We have trouble finding that site".</p>
<p><img src="../img/prob1.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Answer: Your local webserver (Apache) is not running. Please start it via EasyPHP or MAMP control program/panel.</p>
<h3>URL not found (404)</h3>
<p><img src="../img/prob2.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Answer: The server is running, but the application is not found. Maybe the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is wrong or misspelled. Please check/correct it. Or the URI is correct, and the application is installed, but not in the correct directory <em>lwt</em> below <em>htdocs</em>. Please install/copy/move it into the correct directory.</p>
<h3>Database connection error</h3>
<p><img src="../img/prob3.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Answer: Either the database (MySQL) is not running, or the database connection parameters in <em>../htlwt/connect.inc.php</em> are wrong. Please check/correct the database connection parameters and/or start MySQL via the MAMP or EasyPHP control program/panel.</p>
<h3>Cannot find connect.inc.php</h3>
<p><img src="../img/prob4.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Answer: The Webserver and the database is running, but the database connection parameter file <em>../htlwt/connect.inc.php</em> is not found. Please rename one of the connection files (according to your server) to <em>../htlwt/connect.inc.php</em>.</p>
<h3>Do not run on Linux after installation/update</h3>
<p>If LWT installed or updated LWT on Linux, but the application does not run as expected.</p>
<p>Answer 1: The Webserver does not have full access to all LWT files (insufficient rights). Open a terminal window, go to the directory where the directory "lwt" has been created with all LWT files, e. g.<br>
<strong>cd /var/www/html</strong><br>
Now execute:
<strong>sudo chmod -R 755 lwt</strong>.</p>
<p>Answer 2: The PHP "mbstring" extension is not installed. Please install it: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/491629/how-to-install-php-mbstring-extension-in-ubuntu">see this article</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="ipad" name="ipad">▶ Setup for Tablets - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this is a deprecated feature, LWT should work with your tablet out of the box!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to use LWT on a tablet: that's possible (even the audio player works!).</p>
<p>In "Settings/Preferences", set the "Frame Set Display Mode" to "Auto" or "Force Mobile". On other mobile devices, you may also try "Force Non-Mobile" if you are unhappy with the results, try to reduce the length of your texts to reduce scrolling.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to install and run LWT at a web hoster. So you can access LWT easily if you are often on the go.</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy using LWT on a tablet although creating new terms and copy &amp; paste can be a bit tedious.</p>

			<h2 id="termscores" name="termscores">▶ Term Scores - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p>The score of a term is a rough measure (in percent) how well you know a term. It is displayed in "My Terms", and it is used in tests to decide which terms are tested next.</p>
<p>The score is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><img src="../img/score1full.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Terms with status 1 are tested either today (if not created today) or tomorrow (if created today, or a test failed today). Terms set to status 2 should be retested after 2 days. Terms set to status 3 should be retested after 9 days. Terms set to status 4 should be retested after 27 days. Terms set to status 5 should be retested after 72 days.</p>
<p>Example 1: Five terms were tested today; they are now in status 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The term with status 1 is still unknown (failed the test, so the score is still 0 %). The term with status 5 is well known (score: 100 %).</p>
<p><img src="../img/score2.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>Example 2: Five terms were not tested for some time; they are in status 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. All of them have a score of 0, because the number of days indicate that you may have forgotten them. Therefore all should be retested today.</p>

			<h2 id="export" name="export">▶ About LWT Export Templates for "Flexible Exports" - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p>An export template consists of a string of characters.

			<h2 id="contribute" name="contribute">▶ Contributing to LWT - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p>This guide is mainly aimed at developers, but it can give useful insights on how LWT is structured, which could help with debugging. The first step you need to take is to clone LWT from the official GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt">HugoFara/lwt</a>).</p>
<h3>Get Composer</h3>
<p>Getting <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">Composer</a> is required if you want to edit LWT on the server side, but it will also be useful to edit JS and CSS code, so it is <em>highly recommended</em>. Composer is a lightweight dependency manager that <em>does not need</em> a server to run.</p>
<p>Once Composer is ready, go to the lwt folder (most likely <code>lwt/</code>), and type</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer install --dev
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically download all the required dependencies.</p>
<h3>Create and Edit Themes</h3>
<p>Themes are stored at <code>src/themes/</code>. If you want to create a new theme, simply add it to a subfolder. You can also edit existing themes.</p>
<p>To apply the changes you made to a theme, run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer minify
</code></pre>
<p>This command will minify all CSS and JS.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can run</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">php -r "require 'src/php/minifier.php'; minifyAllCSS();"
</code></pre>
<p>It minifies only CSS.</p>
<h4>Debug your theme</h4>
<p>You may not want to see your code minified, so you can use</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer no-minify
</code></pre>
<p>It has the same effect as copying the folder <code>src/themes/</code> to <code>themes/</code>. WARNING: It can break your relative paths!</p>
<h4>Add Images to your Themes</h4>
<p>We support a smart minifying system: relative paths are automatically adapted to point to the previous location <em>while minifying only</em>.
As a consequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use images from <code>css/images/</code> in your theme.
<ul>
<li>If your theme is under <code>src/themes/mytheme/</code>, you should use the path <code>../../../css/theimage</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can add your own files under your custom theme folder.
<ul>
<li>Hence, the path should look like <code>./myimage</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When debugging your theme, files are simply copied to the <code>themes/</code> folder, which can break the path to files in <code>css/</code>.</p>
<h4>My theme does not contain all the Skinning Files</h4>
<p>That's not a problem at all. When LWT looks for a file that should be contained in <code>src/themes/{{The Theme}}/</code>, it checks if the file exists. If not, it goes to <code>css/</code> and tries to get the same file. With this system, your themes <strong>do not need to have the same files as <code>src/css/</code></strong>.</p>
<h3>Change JS behavior</h3>
<p>As with themes, LWT minifies JS code for a better user experience. Please refer to the previous section for detailed explanations; this section will only go through import points.</p>
<h4>Edit JS code</h4>
<p>Clear code is stored at <code>src/js/</code>. Once again, the <em>actual</em> code used by LWT should be at <code>js/</code>. After you have done any modification, either run <code>composer minify</code> or <code>php -r "require 'src/php/minifier.php'; minifyAllJS();"</code>.</p>
<h4>Debug JS code</h4>
<p>To copy code in a non-obfuscated form, run <code>composer no-minify</code> or replace the content of <code>js/</code> with <code>src/js/</code>.</p>
<h3>Edit PHP code</h3>
<p>The PHP codebase is not yet well structured, but here is a general organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages rendered to the client are under the root folder (<code>do_text.php</code>, <code>do_test.php</code>, etc...)</li>
<li>Files that should not be rendered directly are under the <code>inc/</code> ("include") folder.</li>
<li>Other files useful for <em>development only</em> are under <code>src/php/</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Testing your Code</h4>
<p>It is highly advised to test your code. Tests should be wrote under <code>tests/</code>. We use PHP Unit for testing.</p>
<p>To run all tests:</p>
<p><code>composer test</code></p>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<p><code>./vendor/bin/phpunit</code></p>
<h4>Security Check</h4>
<p>We use Psalm to find code flaws and inconsistencies. Use <code>./vendor/bin/psalm</code>.</p>
<p>You can configure the reporting level in <code>psalm.xml</code>.</p>
<h4>Advice: Follow the Code Style Standards</h4>
<p>Nobody likes to debug unreadable code. A good way to avoid thinking about it is to include phpcs directly in your IDE. You can also download it and run it regularly on your code.</p>
<h3>Improving Documentation</h3>
<p>To regenerate all documentation, use <code>composer doc</code>.</p>
<h4>General Documentation</h4>
<p>The documentation is split across Markdown (<code>.md</code>) files in <code>docs/</code>. Then, those files are requested by <code>info.php</code>. The final version is <code>info.html</code>, which contains all files.</p>
<p>To regenerate <code>info.hml</code>, run <code>composer info.html</code>.</p>
<h4>Code Documentation</h4>
<p>Code documentation (everything under <code>docs/html/</code>) is automatically generated. If you see an error, the PHP code is most likely at fault. However, don't hesitate to signal the issue.</p>
<p>Currently, the documentation is generated through Doxygen (run <code>doxygen Doxyfile</code> to regenerate it), but this is likely to change.</p>
<h3>Other Ways of Contribution</h3>
<h4>Drop a star on GitHub</h4>
<p>This is an open-source project. It means that anyone can contribute, but nobody gets paid for improving it. Dropping a star, leaving a comment, or posting an issue is <em>essential</em> because the only reward developers get from time spent on LWT is the opportunity to discuss with users.</p>
<h4>Spread the Word</h4>
<p>LWT is a non-profitable piece of software, so we won't have much time or money to advertise it. If you enjoy LWT and want to see it grow, share it!</p>
<h4>Discuss</h4>
<p>Either go to the forum of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/learning-with-texts/discussion/">official LWT version</a>, or come and <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/discussions">discuss on the community version</a>.</p>

<li>In subdirectory "lwt", rename the file <em>connect_wordpress.inc.php</em> into <em>connect.inc.php</em>, and enter the database parameters $server (database server), $userid (database user id), $passwd (database password), and $dbname (database name, can be the same like your wordpress database, or a different one) by editing the file with a text editor.</li>
<li>In the WordPress General Settings, decide whether anyone can register and use LWT (Membership = "Anyone can register"), or not (an administrator must create new users). The "New User Default Role" should be "Subscriber".</li>
<li>The link to start LWT with <strong>complete</strong> WordPress authentication is:<br>
<em>http://...path-to-wp-blog.../lwt/wp_lwt_start.php</em>
</li>
<li>The link to start LWT (without WordPress authentication, only by checking the session cookie that is valid until the browser is closed) is:<br>
<em>http://...path-to-wp-blog.../lwt/</em><br>
If the session cookie does not exist, both above start methods are the same.</li>
<li>To properly log out from both WordPress and LWT, use the link:<br>
<em>http://...path-to-wp-blog.../lwt/wp_lwt_stop.php</em><br>
The LWT home page has such a link. If you only log out via the links on the WordPress pages, you will still be able to use LWT until the browser is closed. If you want to log out from both WordPress and LWT, use the above link, or click on the link on the LWT home page!</li>
<li>If you delete a user, you must find out its user number (table "wp_users"). After deleting the user in WordPress, you can delete all LWT tables with table names beginning with the user number plus an underscore "_". You can do this in phpMyAdmin.</li>
</ol>
			
			<h2 id="database" name="database">▶ Database Information - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p>The following seventeen tables are one "LWT table set". The default table set has no table name prefix, so the tables are named just as written below: "settings", "languages", etc.</p>
<p>Additional table sets have its "table set name" plus an underscore "_" as a table name prefix: "setname_settings", "setname_languages", etc. The "table set name" is max. 20 characters long. Allowed characters are only: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the underscore "_".</p>
<p>Only if the table set is not set in "connect.inc.php", the currently used table set is saved in a global table "_lwtgeneral", in column LWTValue of row with LWTKey = "current_table_prefix". If such a row does not exist, the default table set will be used, or will be automatically created and used.</p>

			<h2 id="CHANGELOG" name="CHANGELOG">▶ Changelog - <a href="#">[↑]</a></h2>
<p>This project's changelog. Versions marked with "-fork" come from the community, other versions come from the canonical LWT ("official" branch on Git).
For git tags, official releases are marked like "v1.0.0", while unofficial ones are marked like "v1.0.0-fork".</p>
<h3>[Unreleased]</h3>
<h4>Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<code>langFromDict</code> and <code>targetLangFromDict</code> are now officially coming to the kernel utility functions.</li>
<li>Text and title boxes change language according to the text's language for short text creation/edition, long text creation and text check (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/111">#111</a>).</li>
<li>Refactored texts with OOP:
<ul>
<li>New class: <code>Text</code> (in <code>inc/classes/Text.php</code>).</li>
<li>New function: <code>edit_texts_form</code> (in <code>edit_texts.php</code>) that takes a Text object as input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests (checking if you know words) now use AJAX (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/112">#112</a>), it has several advantages:
<ul>
<li>Musics play fully</li>
<li>Page do not need to reload.</li>
<li>The timer continues instead of resetting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>REST API, the new <code>inc/ajax.php</code> is intended to continue developping itself as a REST API.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prettier UI to navigate between text creation/edition/archive pages.</li>
<li>The long text import page looks a bit nicer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>When editing an existing text, surrounding spaces are no longer inserted (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/92">#92</a>).</li>
<li>Language code is better detected from translator url when editing an existing language.</li>
<li>The field "Short Text Import" on long text import and was not redirecting to
the intendended page. Same goes for "New Text" on "Archived Texts" page.</li>
<li>It was impossible to archive more than one text (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/118">#118</a>).</li>
<li>Testing a word was not changing it's color.</li>
<li>A warning was sent 'Undefined array key "query"' when creating a new word (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/121">#121</a>).</li>
<li>A warning when savings settings in <code>settings.php</code> was sometimes displayed (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/121">#121</a>).</li>
<li>Test header was different when testing languages or terms since 2.1.0-fork.</li>
<li>Wrong link to documentation (<code>info.php</code> instead of <code>docs/info.html</code>). Signaled by Mooncake on Discord.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.8.1-fork (April 14 2023)</h3>
<h4>Changed in 2.8.1-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>Updated some documentation screenshots: home screen, language edition and terms upload.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixed in 2.8.1-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since 2.8.0-fork, PHP installations with ext-dom absent or disabled could not display text.</li>
<li>Using the import terms feature, it is better detected if local infile is enabled.</li>
<li>Since 2.2.2-fork, many multi-words were not displayed, as explained in <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/70">#70</a>. Issues may remain.</li>
<li>Auto-translation of all words (bulk translate) could not open dictionaries starting with '*'.</li>
<li>Since 2.7.0-fork, using a dictionary starting with "ggl.php" was creating a fatal error on opening text.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for PHP 7.4 restored, wrappers for <code>str_starts_with</code>, <code>str_ends_with</code>, <code>str_contains</code>.</li>
<li>The encoding of <code>docs/info.html</code> is finally fixed!</li>
<li>
<code>ggl.php</code> feature fixed!</li>

</ul>
<h4>Deprecated in 2.7.0-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dictionary and translator URIs changed:
<ul>
<li>They should <strong>always</strong> be proper URLs.</li>
<li>Replacing <code>###</code> by <code>lwt_term</code> is strongly recommended!</li>
<li>"*" At the beginning of an URI should be replaced by <code>lwt_popup=1</code> as an argument.</li>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>The mobile interface for texts unchanged (2.2.1-fork to 2.5.3-fork).</li>
<li>You can resize frames on desktop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many new functions officially introduced in PHP and JS. Some of these function were already present in the code but undocumented.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 2.6.0-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>UX: Faster testing: you do no longer need to enter "Space" first for speed testing, except for status down and change. Related to <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/71">#71</a>.</li>
<li>UI:
<ul>
<li>Do no longer show "[]" near words when they are no tags. <code>getWordTagList</code> behavior changed (<code>inc/session_utility.php</code>).</li>
<li>Tests have a better general aspect thanks to CSS cleanning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PHP:
<ul>
<li>
<code>do_test.php</code>, <code>edit_texts.php</code>, <code>edit_words.php</code> and <code>set_test_status.php</code> now explicitly require a running session. They were silently failing before this release.</li>
<li>
<code>save_setting_redirect.php</code> moved to <code>inc/save_setting_redirect.php</code>.</li>
<li>Psalm static code analysis of all PHP files.</li>
<li>We use "EOP" for end-of-paragraph markers instead of misleading "EOS" (MeCab).</li>
<li>Slightly changed how a connection is established with SQL. It makes messages more relevant when SQL is not running.</li>
<li>Not Japanese texts now always use the PHP parser. The SQL parser is no longer used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JS: Some deprecated functions <code>escape</code> and <code>unescape</code> were replaced by modern equivalents <code>encodeURIcomponent</code> and <code>decodeURIcomponent</code>. This may lead to changes in cookies, notably making them work better.</li>
<li>DB: the NO_ZERO_DATE mode is no longer required, see <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/78">#78</a>.
<ul>
<li>In the <code>words</code> table, replaced the default timestamp <code>0000-00-00 00:00:00</code> by <code>0000-00-00 00:00:01</code>.</li>
<li>The demo database underwent the same change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated <code>composer.lock</code>.</li>
<li>Docker: more default options, documentation updated.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deprecated in 2.6.0-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<code>do_test_test_css</code> in <code>do_test_test.php</code> is deprecated since it was causing display issues. Its CSS rules were trimmed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Removed in 2.6.0-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ability to use a dictionary with a specific encoding, introduced in 1.0.2, is being removed. It was making things overwhelmingly complex and caused issues, as signaled in <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/58">#58</a>. Adapted from PR <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/59">#59</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixed in 2.6.0-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>Docker:
<ul>
<li>Docker integration repaired (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/37">#37</a>)! Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hakuro-jp">@hakuro-jp</a> for the initial help and <a href="https://github.com/darkone23">@darkone23</a> for the final solution. Without you two I would have long given up with Docker.</li>
<li>Docker continuous integration is back as well due to a rewrite of the workflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Texts:
<ul>
<li>The <em>audio</em> player was no longer working since 2.1.0-fork since the play button was hidden.</li>
<li>Save text position (<code>inc/ajax_save_text_position.php</code>) was broken for all texts. This is fixed.</li>
<li>Right frames should hide automatically but they often don't (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/61">#61</a>). Merged PR <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/62">#62</a>.</li>
<li>Japanese parsing is now better, and uses PHP only (the local_infile SQL functionality is no longer used). Related to PR <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/43">#43</a>.</li>
<li>One-word not Japanese texts do no longer result in a crash (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/80">#80</a>), whoever uses them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>Header was hidden during tests on Chrome-based browsers.</li>
<li>Testing specific terms was broken (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/66">#66</a>) and tests were sometimes not counting score. Solution inspired from PR <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/67">#67</a> from <a href="https://github.com/jzohrab">@jzohrab</a>.</li>
<li>Sometimes tests were loop-reloading clicking after setting new status, this is fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JS:
<ul>
<li>You should no longer see annoying console messages of "cClick" crashing on "obj is null".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PHP:
<ul>
<li>Type fixes thanks to psalm:
<ul>
<li>
<code>get_first_value</code> documentation updated since it was also returning <code>float</code> and <code>int</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>get_similar_terms</code> in <code>simterms.php</code> officially returns int.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inconsistent option in <code>inc/ajax_save_setting.php</code>.
<ul>
<li>Since 2.2.2-fork, you had to use a GET request to use it, resulting in authorization errors.</li>
<li>POST requests are now again the default way to use it.</li>
<li>PHP tries to set the allow_local_infile option during the connection with SQL (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/20">#20</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/40">#40</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UI
<ul>
<li>Audio in <code>edit_texts.php</code> was never shown.</li>
<li>When adding text, the user was ask to create a <code>media</code> folder in <code>...</code>, corrected to <code>..</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DB:
<ul>
<li>For some users it was impossible to install the default database due to the use of a ZERO date (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/78">#78</a>).</li>
<li>Deleted wrong database instructions <code>ADD DROP INDEX TiTextLC</code> altering <code>temptextitems</code> in <code>update_database</code> of <code>database_connect.php</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Multiple fixes to the "I Known All Words" feature. Great thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jzohrab">@jzohrab</a>!
<ul>
<li>Setting all words to well-known was resulting in a crash when no words were added as well-known (<code>all_words_wellknown.php</code>).</li>
<li>Setting all words to well-known was resulting in a crash when multiple words had the same lowercase value. See issue <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/46">#46</a>!</li>
<li>Words were not updated in the view unless reparsing the text (<a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/48">#48</a>). Merged pull request <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/49">#49</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the main dropdown menu, the option "Text-to-Speech Settings" was still leading to <code>tts.php</code> (now <code>text_to_speech_settings.php</code>). Merged pull request <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/pull/51">#51</a>, thanks <a href="https://github.com/jzohrab">@jzohrab</a>.</li>

<h4>Fixed in 2.5.1-fork</h4>
<ul>

<li>The "database update" part of <code>check_update_db</code> in <code>inc/database_connect.php</code> was moved to <code>update_database</code>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Better browser caching: JS code is downloaded once for all.</li>
<li>Easier maintaining: it was difficult to manage which php file was needing which JS script.</li>
<li>Consistency: scripts were calling functions that should be imported from other files, making the debugging difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feed wizard changes
<ul>
<li>The feed wizard got a little broken: the "next" button is always active, even if you did not select text and click "Get".</li>

<li>We do no longer load pages in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode">Almost Standards Mode</a>. Unless you use some Netscape browser, it should not impact you.</li>

<li>Creating the database was sometimes impossible.</li>
<li>Database names containing special characters (hyphens, carets, etc...) was not possible.</li>

<li>In <code>edit_texts.php</code>, it was not displayed in the barchart when knowing 1 word. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/chaosarium">@chaosarium</a> for signaling it (issue <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/11">#11</a>).</li>
<li>Tags were breaking text modification. Issue <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/12">#12</a>, thanks <a href="https://github.com/chaosarium">@chaosarium</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Changes from official LWT version 1.5.20 imported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possibility to display similar terms while creating or editing a term. This will give you more language insight, and may ease inputting new terms that are similar. The number of displayed similar terms can be set from 0 (old behavior, default) to 9 on the "Settings" page. Clicking on the green icon in front of a similar term will copy the translation and romanization into the form fields for further editing. Important: If you want to use this new feature, you must change the setting "Similar terms to be displayed while adding/editing a term" to a value greater than 0. It will make more sense to do this if you have already many saved terms (e.g. more than 1,000). If you start with a language and have only a few terms, no or not very similar terms will be normally displayed and this feature will not make much sense.</li>
<li>"https://" dictionary URIs are now allowed in the language settings. Checking of dictionary URIs in the language settings has been improved.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 1.6.1-fork</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Glosbe dictionary page has been improved with a simple form to change the term and do a requery if you are unhappy with the query results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The jQuery and jPlayer libraries have been updated to v1.11.1 and v2.7.0, respectively. The jQuery.ScrollTo package has been updated to v1.4.13. The Floating Menu package has been updated to v1.12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broken links corrected or deleted. From now on, only the installation with EasyPHP for Windows and MAMP for Mac OS X will be explained in detail and is recommended. Other local web server packages, like XAMPP, etc., are of course still possible, but it's beyond the scope of this document to explain all the details for every webserver package (it will also confuse most LWT users who are not familiar with web server packages and their setup).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Mobile_Detect.php" updated to v2.8.3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation updated.</p>

<h3>1.5.18 (September 14 2014)</h3>
<h4>Added in 1.5.18</h4>
<ul>
<li>Possibility to display similar terms while creating or editing a term. This will give you more language insight, and may ease inputting new terms that are similar. The number of displayed similar terms can be set from 0 (old behavior, default) to 9 on the "Settings" page. Clicking on the green icon in front of a similar term will copy the translation and romanization into the form fields for further editing. Important: If you want to use this new feature, you must change the setting "Similar terms to be displayed while adding/editing a term" to a value greater than 0. It will make more sense to do this if you have already many saved terms (e.g. more than 1,000). If you start with a language and have only a few terms, no or not very similar terms will be normally displayed and this feature will not make much sense.</li>
<li>New sort option for texts, terms or tags: "Oldest first".</li>
<li>The Catalan language has been added to the Language Settings Wizard.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 1.5.18</h4>

You can also create one table set for every language you study - this allows you to create different term/text tags for each language. If you don't need this feature, you just use LWT like in earlier versions with the "default table set". Read more <a href="info.html#mue">here</a> and <a href="info.html#database">here</a>.</li>

<li>In the "Read Text" frame, the next unknown (blue) word in the text can now be shown for term creation just by pressing the RETURN key. The term will be marked by a red border. You type in the translation, etc., and press RETURN to save the word. Now you can press RETURN again to show the next unknown (blue) word, enter a translation, save it, and so on... There is sometimes the problem that some external dictionaries catch the focus although the cursor should be in the translation field in the edit frame. Especially Chrome behaves badly, and I cannot change this. Please try different dictionaries and/or browsers.</li>
<li>You can also review/manage saved (non-blue) terms with key strokes in the "Read Text" frame (RIGHT or SPACE: next term, LEFT: previous term, PAGE-UP or HOME: first term, PAGE-DOWN or END: last term, NUMBER KEYS 1-5: set current term status to 1-5, I: set current term status to "Ignored", W: set current term status to "Well known", E: edit current term, ESC: reset).

<ul>
<li>Checking maximum text length in text input/edit/check screens.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 1.0.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Code cleanup and optimization, better code documentation.</li>
<li>Media directory is not anymore included, user has to create it if needed. The demo media are now all online.</li>
<li>Demo database installation is now done within LWT (optional). If the database is empty, a hint on the main screen is displayed either to install the demo db or to start with the definition of a language. Backup/Restore now with more hints and an option to install the demo database.</li>
<li>Documentation and screenshots updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.0.3 (August 09 2011)</h3>
<h4>Added in 1.0.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>New button to open a new text immediately after saving.</li>
<li>Dictionaries can now be opened not only within the frame set (default) but also in a popup window (please deactivate popup window blocking in your browser!). To open a dictionary in a separate popup window, put an asterisk * in front of the Uniform Resource Identifier (Example: *<a href="http://mywebdict.com?q=###).">http://mywebdict.com?q=###).</a> Please use this method if a web dictionary does not open properly within the frame set.</li>
<li>The application now always checks if the current text or language still exist (could have sometimes resulted in empty query results after deleting).</li>
<li>New settings "Texts per Page", "Show Word Counts of Texts immediately", "Archived Texts per Page" and "Terms per Page". You can now define how many texts or terms are on one page. As the calculation of text word counts can slow down the loading of a long text table, you can switch off this calculation (and do the calculation later).<br>
"New/Edit Term" now allow dictionary lookup (always in popup window). If you want to enter a term manually, you must first select the language on the "My Terms" page.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 1.0.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Documentation and screenshots updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.0.2 (August 05 2011)</h3>
<h4>Added in 1.0.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Language definition: If the searchword in the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) needs to be converted into a different encoding (standard is UTF-8), you can now use <em>###encoding###</em> as a placeholder. Example: <em><a href="http://mywebdict.com?q=###ISO-8859-15###">http://mywebdict.com?q=###ISO-8859-15###</a></em>. A list of encodings can be found <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php">here</a> (omit the asterisk if one is at the end).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 1.0.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Documentation and screenshots updated. Thai example added in demo database.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.0.1 (August 04 2011)</h3>
<h4>Added in 1.0.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Empty database will be created automatically if database does not exist. Tables will be automatically recreated if some or all tables are missing. System handles (future) database changes automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 1.0.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Testing: Last term tested will not show up immediately. Automatically selected sentences in tests now must not contain unsaved (blue) words. This does not apply if a sentence saved with a term contains unknown words - such sentences may come up within a test.</li>
<li>Documentation and screenshots updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.0.0 (August 01 2011)</h3>
<ul>
<li>First stable release. For some time, there won't be any new releases. I hope you'll understand that. Please post all problems, questions, and (hopefully not too many) bugs <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lwt/forums/forum/1813497">here</a>, and ideas and suggestions for new features <a href="http://lwt.uservoice.com">here</a>. Thanks!</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.8 (July 31 2011)</h3>
<h4>Added in 0.9.8</h4>
<ul>
<li>New Text Display Mode (see new checkbox on the "Read text" screen).
<ul>
<li>[Show All] = ON (the only mode in previous releases): ALL terms are shown, and all multi-word terms are shown as superscripts before the first word. The superscript indicates the number of words in the multi-word term.</li>
<li>[Show All] = OFF (new): Multi-word terms now hide single words and shorter or overlapping multi-word terms. This makes it easier to concentrate on multi-word terms while displaying them without superscripts, but creation and deletion of multi-word terms can be a bit slow in long texts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 0.9.8</h4>
<ul>
<li>Documentation and screenshots updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.7 (July 28 2011)</h3>
<h4>Changed in 0.9.7</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>0.9.6 (July 26 2011)</h3>
<h4>Changed in 0.9.6</h4>
<ul>
<li>More visual improvements (layout, tables, etc.), many improvements and bugfixes. Dictionary Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) use now ### as a placeholder for the searchword. If ### is missing, the searchword will be appended (like in older versions). More multi-actions for terms. Translation and sentence fields do NOT accept newlines anymore, now the form is submitted. Status entry changed from dropdown to radio buttons. Backup/Restore improved. CSS and XHTML corrected and validated. Korean example added. An Anki example deck is now provided: "LWT.anki" in directory "anki". Documentation and screenshots improved.</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.5 (July 23 2011)</h3>
<h4>Changed in 0.9.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Visual improvements (icons), a few bug fixes. Database Restore changed for bigger files. Two new tests to test L2 -&gt; L1 or L1 -&gt; L2 without sentence (just the term). The term filter operates not only on the term field but also on the romanization and translation field.</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.4 (July 22 2011)</h3>
<h4>Added in 0.9.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>New buttons to switch easier between active texts and archived texts.</li>
<li>New settings "Testing: Number of sentences displayed from text, if available" and "Terms: Number of sentences generated from text, if available". Default is "Just ONE". The options "TWO (+ previous)" and "THREE (+ previous, + next)" now allow you to do MCD (Massive-Context Cloze Deletion) testing, as proposed by Khatzumoto @ AJATT.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changed in 0.9.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>"Import of terms" now only needs a translation if the status is set to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Furthermore it not only imports terms as TAB (ASCII 9) separated values (TSV) or "#" separated values, but also as comma separated values (CSV, strings in quotes ("...", if needed), a quote within a string as double quotes (""); this is the format that LingQ uses for exporting terms).</li>
<li>Some minor bug fixes. Documentation updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.3 (July 21 2011)</h3>
<h4>Fixed in 0.9.3</h4>
