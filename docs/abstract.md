# Abstract

[_Learning with Texts_ (LWT)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts/) is a tool for Language Learning by reading texts.
It is inspired by:
  * [Stephen Krashen's](http://sdkrashen.com) principles in Second Language Acquisition,
  * Steve Kaufmann's [LingQ](http://lingq.com) System and
  * Ideas from Khatzumoto, published at ["AJATT - All Japanese All The Time"](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com).

You define languages you want to learn and import texts you want to use for learning. While listening to the optional audio, you read the text, save, review and test "terms" (words or multi word expressions, 2 to 9 words).

In new texts all your previously saved words and expressions are displayed according to their current learn statuses, tooltips show translations and romanizations (readings), editing, changing the status, dictionary lookup, etc. is just a click away.

Import of terms in TSV/CSV format, export in TSV format, and export to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) (prepared for cloze tests), are also possible.  

To run LWT, you'll need:  

1. **A modern web browser**. Do not use Internet Explorer, any other browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge) should be fine.
2. **A local web server**.
    An easy way to install a local web server are preconfigured packages like
    * [EasyPHP](http://www.easyphp.org/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) (Windows), or
    * [MAMP](http://mamp.info/en/index.html) (macOS), or
    * a [LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) (Linux).
3. **The LWT Application**. The latest version  _lwt\_v\_x\_y.zip_ can be downloaded at <https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>. View the [install section](info.html#install).
